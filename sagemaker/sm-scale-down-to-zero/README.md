# Scale to zero endpoint

This code sample has been adapted from the original reference implementation and modified to extend LLM-based model functionality to **traditional models**.

Here are example notebooks demonstrating SageMaker's new scale-to-zero feature. These complement the blog post: [Unlock cost savings with the new scale down to zero feature in SageMaker Inference](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/blogs/machine-learning/unlock-cost-savings-with-the-new-scale-down-to-zero-feature-in-amazon-sagemaker-inference/)
