The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements.

Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found.

      "['Create venues (Labs). In Knox Asset Intelligence, Venues are a way of identifying geographical areas for the purpose of indoor location tracking. A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2. Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You\\'ll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you\\'ve selected the type of venue you want to create, you\\'ll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor']\n",

A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2. Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You\\'ll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you\\'ve selected the type of venue you want to create, you\\'ll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor']\n",

      "[\"Manage assets. The Location Assets page lets you quickly see the location status and last known update times for all of your enrolled devices. The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements. To create a set: 1. On the Assets page, click the SETS tab, then click NEW SET. The Add devices to new set page opens. 2. Select one or more devices from the list, then click ADD. You can also use the search bar to find devices before adding. 3. In the Create new set dialogue, give your set a name and optional description, then click ADD. The name can only contain alphabet, number, dash, or period characters, and cannot be more than 18 characters in length. 4. Navigate back to the SETS tab to view a list of all sets in your fleet. To edit your set information: 1. Click a SET ID from the list. A side-panel displays your set information. 2. Click Edit to change your set name, use to toggle to make the set Active or Inactive, or click DELETE SET to remove it entirely. To add devices to a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Add devices to set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click ADD. To remove devices from a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Remove devices from set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click REMOVE. To delete multiple sets at the same time: 1. Select the sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Delete set(s). 2. In the Delete set(s) dialogue, click CONFIRM. The default set (S.0) is created automatically for all customers using indoor-location tracking. This set can't be deleted. To download your sets information as a CSV file, select the one or more sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Download CSV. View asset information Viewing asset information from the Location dashboard is similar to viewing device information from the Devices page. Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found. The Find asset tools only work for mobile devices, and not immovable objects. To find an asset: 1. On the Assets page, use the checkboxes to select one or more devices, then click ACTIONS > Find asset\"]\n",

      "['Create venues (Labs). In Knox Asset Intelligence, Venues are a way of identifying geographical areas for the purpose of indoor location tracking. A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2. Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You\\'ll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you\\'ve selected the type of venue you want to create, you\\'ll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor']\n",

      "[\"Manage assets. The Location Assets page lets you quickly see the location status and last known update times for all of your enrolled devices. The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements. To create a set: 1. On the Assets page, click the SETS tab, then click NEW SET. The Add devices to new set page opens. 2. Select one or more devices from the list, then click ADD. You can also use the search bar to find devices before adding. 3. In the Create new set dialogue, give your set a name and optional description, then click ADD. The name can only contain alphabet, number, dash, or period characters, and cannot be more than 18 characters in length. 4. Navigate back to the SETS tab to view a list of all sets in your fleet. To edit your set information: 1. Click a SET ID from the list. A side-panel displays your set information. 2. Click Edit to change your set name, use to toggle to make the set Active or Inactive, or click DELETE SET to remove it entirely. To add devices to a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Add devices to set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click ADD. To remove devices from a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Remove devices from set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click REMOVE. To delete multiple sets at the same time: 1. Select the sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Delete set(s). 2. In the Delete set(s) dialogue, click CONFIRM. The default set (S.0) is created automatically for all customers using indoor-location tracking. This set can't be deleted. To download your sets information as a CSV file, select the one or more sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Download CSV. View asset information Viewing asset information from the Location dashboard is similar to viewing device information from the Devices page. Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found. The Find asset tools only work for mobile devices, and not immovable objects. To find an asset: 1. On the Assets page, use the checkboxes to select one or more devices, then click ACTIONS > Find asset\"]\n",

      "['Create venues (Labs). In Knox Asset Intelligence, Venues are a way of identifying geographical areas for the purpose of indoor location tracking. A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2. Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You\\'ll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you\\'ve selected the type of venue you want to create, you\\'ll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor']\n",

      "[\"Manage assets. The Location Assets page lets you quickly see the location status and last known update times for all of your enrolled devices. The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements. To create a set: 1. On the Assets page, click the SETS tab, then click NEW SET. The Add devices to new set page opens. 2. Select one or more devices from the list, then click ADD. You can also use the search bar to find devices before adding. 3. In the Create new set dialogue, give your set a name and optional description, then click ADD. The name can only contain alphabet, number, dash, or period characters, and cannot be more than 18 characters in length. 4. Navigate back to the SETS tab to view a list of all sets in your fleet. To edit your set information: 1. Click a SET ID from the list. A side-panel displays your set information. 2. Click Edit to change your set name, use to toggle to make the set Active or Inactive, or click DELETE SET to remove it entirely. To add devices to a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Add devices to set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click ADD. To remove devices from a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Remove devices from set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click REMOVE. To delete multiple sets at the same time: 1. Select the sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Delete set(s). 2. In the Delete set(s) dialogue, click CONFIRM. The default set (S.0) is created automatically for all customers using indoor-location tracking. This set can't be deleted. To download your sets information as a CSV file, select the one or more sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Download CSV. View asset information Viewing asset information from the Location dashboard is similar to viewing device information from the Devices page. Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found. The Find asset tools only work for mobile devices, and not immovable objects. To find an asset: 1.

A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate.

Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You\\'ll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you\\'ve selected the type of venue you want to create, you\\'ll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor']\n",

      "[\"Manage assets. The Location Assets page lets you quickly see the location status and last known update times for all of your enrolled devices. The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements. To create a set: 1. On the Assets page, click the SETS tab, then click NEW SET. The Add devices to new set page opens. 2. Select one or more devices from the list, then click ADD. You can also use the search bar to find devices before adding. 3. In the Create new set dialogue, give your set a name and optional description, then click ADD. The name can only contain alphabet, number, dash, or period characters, and cannot be more than 18 characters in length. 4. Navigate back to the SETS tab to view a list of all sets in your fleet. To edit your set information: 1. Click a SET ID from the list. A side-panel displays your set information. 2. Click Edit to change your set name, use to toggle to make the set Active or Inactive, or click DELETE SET to remove it entirely. To add devices to a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Add devices to set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click ADD. To remove devices from a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Remove devices from set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click REMOVE. To delete multiple sets at the same time: 1. Select the sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Delete set(s). 2. In the Delete set(s) dialogue, click CONFIRM. The default set (S.0) is created automatically for all customers using indoor-location tracking. This set can't be deleted. To download your sets information as a CSV file, select the one or more sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Download CSV. View asset information Viewing asset information from the Location dashboard is similar to viewing device information from the Devices page. Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found. The Find asset tools only work for mobile devices, and not immovable objects. To find an asset: 1.

      "['Create venues (Labs). In Knox Asset Intelligence, Venues are a way of identifying geographical areas for the purpose of indoor location tracking. A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2.
