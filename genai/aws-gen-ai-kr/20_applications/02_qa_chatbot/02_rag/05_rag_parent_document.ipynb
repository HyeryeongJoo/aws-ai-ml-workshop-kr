To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard\"]\n",

      "[\"Knox licenses. Samsung offers a variety of Knox licenses to support your device management needs. If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services. Enter cloud license keys on the Knox Admin Portal, and enter on-premises license keys directly on the service console.

      "[\"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard\"]\n",

      "['DeX. The available DeX policies include: Basic policy controls - These standard controls allow you to perform simple actions, such as enable or disable DeX. These policies are listed under DO > DeX policy > Manage DeX restrictions. Customization controls - These additional customization options allow you to change the DeX setup and user experience. Use of these policies requires a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Enable DeX The process to enable DeX is simple and only requires you to turn on a few policies as follows: 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. To disable DeX, simply turn off Allow DeX connection, as shown in the previous example. Enable DeX with basic customization This example shows you how to enable DeX so it auto-launches and sets a specific screen timeout. Note that all DeX customization policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under DeX customization profile, enable Auto-start DeX on HDMI connection. 5. Under DeX customization profile, find Set screen timeout and input your desired value. 6. Under DeX customization profile, disable Allow screen timeout change. 7. The device now launches DeX automatically when it is plugged in to an HDMI cable. 8. Once the device is connected to DeX, a Display resolution screen displays. Select a single resolution value for the connected display. Unselected display options will be greyed out and unavailable. Keep in mind, changing the resolution makes displayed windows, text and other items appear small or larger. Options include, WQHD (2560 x 1440), FHD (1920 x 1080) _recommended setting_, HD+ (1600 x 900), WQXGA (2560 x 1600), WUXGA (1920 x 1200), or UWQHD (3440 x 1440). Select Done to commit the selected display setting. If the display resolution provided is not supported, then FHD (1920 x 1080) is selected by default and non-supported resolutions are greyed out in the DeX Display resolution screen. Industry example This example configures a tablet in DeX mode, so a bank employee can use it to help customers with day to day operations. For example opening a new account or checking account balances. In this use case, DeX is used as a dedicated employee work station and the bank can slowly phase out older, single-purpose computer terminals. These instructions do not apply to any specific UEM. Refer to your UEM documentation for specific instructions on menu structure and navigation. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under DeX Policy, turn on Enable DeX policy controls. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Customize DeX Experience. 5. Set the DeX profile name to an appropriate value. For example, the following image shows a profile called Bank Terminal. 6. Under DeX customization profile, type the name of the DeX Profile you set in the previous step. In this example, it is Bank Terminal 7. Under DeX customization profile, enable DeX Auto Start on HDMI connection This setting minimizes potential troubleshooting for employees and can reduce IT overhead. If a device is unplugged, setting up the bank terminal again is as simple as plugging the device back in to an HDMI cable. 8. Under DeX customization profile, enable Disable buttons on the DeX panel. Select the buttons you want to disable. For example, selecting Exit DeX button prevents users from exiting the bank terminal and using the device for other purposes. 9. Under DeX customization profile, turn on Skip overscan detection screen']\n",
