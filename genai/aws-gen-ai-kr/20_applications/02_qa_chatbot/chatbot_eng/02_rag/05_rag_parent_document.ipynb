      "['DeX. The available DeX policies include: Basic policy controls - These standard controls allow you to perform simple actions, such as enable or disable DeX. These policies are listed under DO > DeX policy > Manage DeX restrictions. Customization controls - These additional customization options allow you to change the DeX setup and user experience. Use of these policies requires a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Enable DeX The process to enable DeX is simple and only requires you to turn on a few policies as follows: 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. To disable DeX, simply turn off Allow DeX connection, as shown in the previous example. Enable DeX with basic customization This example shows you how to enable DeX so it auto-launches and sets a specific screen timeout. Note that all DeX customization policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under DeX customization profile, enable Auto-start DeX on HDMI connection. 5. Under DeX customization profile, find Set screen timeout and input your desired value. 6. Under DeX customization profile, disable Allow screen timeout change. 7. The device now launches DeX automatically when it is plugged in to an HDMI cable. 8. Once the device is connected to DeX, a Display resolution screen displays. Select a single resolution value for the connected display. Unselected display options will be greyed out and unavailable. Keep in mind, changing the resolution makes displayed windows, text and other items appear small or larger. Options include, WQHD (2560 x 1440), FHD (1920 x 1080) _recommended setting_, HD+ (1600 x 900), WQXGA (2560 x 1600), WUXGA (1920 x 1200), or UWQHD (3440 x 1440). Select Done to commit the selected display setting. If the display resolution provided is not supported, then FHD (1920 x 1080) is selected by default and non-supported resolutions are greyed out in the DeX Display resolution screen. Industry example This example configures a tablet in DeX mode, so a bank employee can use it to help customers with day to day operations. For example opening a new account or checking account balances. In this use case, DeX is used as a dedicated employee work station and the bank can slowly phase out older, single-purpose computer terminals. These instructions do not apply to any specific UEM. Refer to your UEM documentation for specific instructions on menu structure and navigation. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under DeX Policy, turn on Enable DeX policy controls. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Customize DeX Experience. 5. Set the DeX profile name to an appropriate value. For example, the following image shows a profile called Bank Terminal. 6. Under DeX customization profile, type the name of the DeX Profile you set in the previous step. In this example, it is Bank Terminal 7. Under DeX customization profile, enable DeX Auto Start on HDMI connection This setting minimizes potential troubleshooting for employees and can reduce IT overhead. If a device is unplugged, setting up the bank terminal again is as simple as plugging the device back in to an HDMI cable. 8. Under DeX customization profile, enable Disable buttons on the DeX panel. Select the buttons you want to disable. For example, selecting Exit DeX button prevents users from exiting the bank terminal and using the device for other purposes. 9. Under DeX customization profile, turn on Skip overscan detection screen']\n",
