How does RKP protect critical kernel data structures from modification?,The RKP prevents modification of critical kernel data structures by restricting access to them and by implementing signatures and checksums to detect any changes,7bf951c1-4a6c-4e43-a8bf-6d8e0daff488,". Kernel data - RKP""prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP""prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw"
Explain how return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented programming (JOP) attacks work to exploit vulnerabilities in the kernel's existing logic and code. Why can't a kernel protection mechanism exist solely within the kernel itself?,"ROP and JOP attacks reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code, by chaining together sequences of gadget-like instructions that redirect control and data, allowing an attacker to exploit flaws that are present in the kernel in order to gain unauthorized access. A kernel protection mechanism cannot exist solely within the kernel itself, because an attacker could circumvent it by exploiting a vulnerability in the kernel itself",7bf951c1-4a6c-4e43-a8bf-6d8e0daff488,".
