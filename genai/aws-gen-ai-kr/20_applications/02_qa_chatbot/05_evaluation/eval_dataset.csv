Furthermore, the EMM group search lets you: Sync all the groups that are displayed in the search results. When you perform a search, the Sync all groups switch temporarily transitions to Sync all groups in search results. Any syncing changes you make are preserved even after you clear the search. Once you clear the search, the switch transitions back to Sync all groups. Search and add a maximum of 1,000 device groups for syncing without triggering a warning. Enroll devices by EMM group Perform this procedure if you want to enroll one or more device groups to Knox E-FOTA. This means that all devices in the device groups you select will be enrolled. 1. In the EMM groups tab, select the device groups you want to enroll. 2. Click Actions > Enroll devices in groups. The Select license pop-up shows the active licenses that have enough seats to accommodate all devices in your selected device group(s). If you want to see all licenses, click Clear Filters. 3. Select the license you want to use, and click Done. Assign a device group to a campaign Perform this procedure if you want to assign all devices in a device group to a campaign. 1.

If you want to see all campaigns (including expired ones), click Clear Filters. The Select license pop-up shows the active licenses that have enough seats to accommodate all devices in your selected device group(s). If you want to see all licenses, click Clear Filters. 3. Select the campaign to assign, and click Done. #Default campaigns When you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is then assigned only to devices in this group when they're synced from the EMM for the first time. These synced devices exhibit the following properties: The default campaign associated with these devices changes if their EMM group or EMM group priority changes. Note that these devices are not automatically assigned to the changed default campaign. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you sync from the EMM again. You can assign the default campaign to these devices, regardless of whether they were uploaded by a reseller or in bulk using a CSV file. You can also find information about the default campaign by selecting an EMM group on the EMM groups page. Manage group priority Managing group priority is useful in cases where a device is included in multiple EMM groups. Assigning group priority allows you to specify which device group takes precedence in the event of a campaign conflict. For example, device A is in both group1 and group2. If group1 is assigned to campaign1 and group2 is assigned to campaign2, which campaign is device A assigned to? The answer depends on which group has a higher priority. To manage group priority: 1. On the EMM groups page: Click Actions > Manage group priority, or , Click Manage all group priority. 2. Click one or more groups and reassign their priority using the upward or downward arrow. 3. Optionally click Move to Top or Move to Bottom on the top right to reassign the priority of one or more groups in one swift action. 4. Click Update groups priority. EMM group auto-sync As an IT admin, you can configure Knox E-FOTA to automatically sync any changes made to EMM groups. To do so, on the EMM groups tab: 1. Switch on the Auto-sync switch to immediately send a group sync request to your EMM. 2. Switch off the Auto-sync switch to disable the auto-sync process. EMM groups are no longer updated based on the pre-defined sync interval. Moreover, the Auto-sync switch is switched off by default. The EMM group information is updated automatically, based on the sync interval shown beside the Next sync field. The interval defaults to 24 hours. If the group sync is pending or if it fails, the switch is switched off and you must manually switch it on again to enable auto-sync. You can't manually sync EMM groups until the current EMM group syncing process is complete. During this process, the Sync now action becomes unavailable and temporarily transitions to Syncing status. Additionally, the Status column also temporarily transitions to Syncing. EMM re-authentication A banner at the top of your Knox E-FOTA console notifies you when devices fail to sync with the EMM. To reconnect them with the EMM: 1. Reset your client secret on the EMM console. 2. Click RECONNECT in the banner at the top of your Knox E-FOTA console. 3. Enter your new client secret to connect with your EMM, then click CONNECT AND SYNC DEVICES. Also, as an IT admin, you can update your EMM connection credentials anytime: 1. On the EMM groups page, click Actions > Reconnect EMM > Click Connect if all the details are correct. Doing so initiates the EMM reconnection. 2. A toast notification confirms the outcome of the reconnection. Available only to IT admins with EMM reconnection permissions. Policies to prevent accidental status changes when syncing from an EMM Knox E-FOTA follows the following policies to ensure that any device you add individually is properly managed if you later sync that device through an EMM group: Deleting a device from your EMM console does not delete it from the Knox E-FOTA console. Only the group information is removed, while campaign, license, and upload source information is kept. You can manually delete these devices on the Devices tab or through a CSV file upload. 1. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then add its device group from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, that device will keep its current status until the EMM group's initial status changes from Synced to something else. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1. When you add Group 1 to Knox E-FOTA, it will get the status Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status. 2. When an EMM group's status changes from the initial Synced status to something else, all its members will follow the new status. Example: Continuing the example above - if you assign Group 1 to Campaign B, all its members, including Device A, will also be assigned to Campaign B. 3. If an EMM group is explicitly unenrolled, all its members will also be unenrolled. Example: Continuing the example above - if you unenroll Group 1, all its members, including Device A, will also be unenrolled. 4. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then add its device groups (multiple groups) from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, the device will follow the policy of the group with the higher priority. Group priority is set in Knox E-FOTA. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1 and Group 2. When you add Group 1 and Group 2 to Knox E-FOTA, they will both get the initial status, Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status (following the first policy above). In this example, Group 1 has a higher priority than Group 2, so Device A will follow Group 1's policy. If you enroll Group 2 and assign it to Campaign B, Device A is unaffected. Since Group 1 is still in its initial Synced status, Device A will continue to retain its Assigned status. When you enroll Group 1 and assign it to Campaign C, Device A will also be assigned to Campaign C (following the second policy above)."

If the campaign expires, factory reset remains disabled on the device until you unassign it. #Support Contact Details Enter a phone number and email address end users can contact for support. You can also set these values as the default contact information for future campaigns. 3. Assign devices to the campaign: 1. Click Assign Devices. 2. On the Assign devices page, select one or more devices to assign to the campaign. By default, the device list is pre-filtered to show only the following: Devices that aren't assigned to any campaign. Devices assigned to expired or canceled campaigns. If you want to select a device currently assigned to an active campaign, click Clear Filters. Devices that are not enrolled are excluded from the device list. Only enrolled devices can be assigned to a campaign. When you download the device list as a CSV file, the file will contain the version of the Knox E-FOTA client app installed on each device. 3. Click Assign. The table at the bottom of the form is populated based on the devices you selected. 4. For each row in the table, click on EDIT and do one of the following: Click Latest firmware if you want the campaign to automatically push the latest firmware version to the assigned devices. Additionally, select one of the following: Any - The latest firmware, regardless of its OS version, is pushed to devices. Up to - The latest firmware, within a particular OS version, is pushed to devices. If you select this option, you may not receive security patches included in the latest firmware of the latest OS version. If no firmware meeting your criteria is available for devices of a particular model-carrier pair, an error is displayed. Click Lock current firmware if you want to prevent any firmware from being installed on the corresponding devices. Click Select from firmware list if you want to select a firmware version to push to the corresponding devices. Then, select the target firmware in the next page.

If you do not see the firmware list for a device model you've just added, try again in a few hours. If Knox E-FOTA is in the process of syncing the firmware list for your assigned devices, you'll have to wait until the firmware sync is complete. You'll receive an email notification when the firmware is ready to be used. If you purchased the Software Customization Services license, you can request custom firmware from a Samsung admin. Once you've received custom firmware from a Samsung admin, you'll find it in the Custom Firmware tab when selecting your target firmware. If you have purchased support for Enterprise Security Patches (ESP), you can select them as target firmware in the firmware list. 5. Click Create and Activate. A notification is displayed confirming that the campaign was created. The campaign is added to the Campaigns list. 6. (Optional) Set a gradual campaign rollout A gradual rollout means that, once the campaign begins, small batches of devices update their firmware every day, rather than the whole pool of devices on the first day. The campaign then continues to roll out updates progressively until all devices are updated by the campaign's end date. Such a gradual rollout can provide you the opportunity to troubleshoot issues with firmware rollout as they arise, so that erroneous or vulnerable patches aren't immediately propagated to all devices at once. The rollout rate defines the size each device batch, meaning the number of devices that update each day. The rate is calculated as a percentage of the total device pool. In determining the rollout schedule, each device is given a random start date. For example, a rollout rate of 20% triggers firmware updates on 20% of the devices on the first day, the next 20% the day after, until, by the fifth day, 100% of the devices are updated. Gradual campaign rollout exhibits the following behavior: 1. Changes to either the rollout rate, target firmware version, or campaign status will reset the rollout start date of all assigned devices. 2. Rolling out a campaign to newly assigned devices doesn't reset the rollout start date of devices that were already assigned the campaign, preventing any delay in pushing firmware updates. A device that is off during this campaign period will have a pending status until the device is turned on. If the device remains off during the duration of the campaign period, it won't receive the command to update. In some cases, especially when upgrading devices to a major Android OS version, several firmware updates are installed incrementally to reach the target firmware version, even if you only applied one campaign. This process results in devices automatically rebooting multiple times, corresponding to the number of firmware updates that actually occurred. Assign devices to an existing campaign You can assign devices to an existing campaign: 1. Go to Devices. 2. Select the devices you want to assign. 3. Click ACTIONS > Assign campaign. 4. Select which campaign to assign the devices to. 5. Click ASSIGN."

Support for a certificate password field in configuration file The Knox E-FOTA On-Premises agent now allows you to input required passwords through an additional field in the efota_config file. If you're familiar with the Android API, you can also add an Android intent listener to define the password. See Step 1 - Download and install the agent app for more details. Improvements to service performance Starting with the 23.04 release, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises now automatically evenly polls device groups for updates. If you allocated a maximum bandwidth per device in the campaign policy, the agent ensures it meets the download speed limit by stopping and starting the firmware download as needed. Enhancements to bulk device deletion Previously, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises didn't require additional confirmation from you when bulk deleting devices. With the 23.04 release, when you delete devices in bulk, a dialog asks you to confirm before the operation begins. Enhancements to device tags Prior to the 23.04 release, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises only supported device tags up to 10 characters long. When the maximum device tag length was reached, no error message would display in the console. To allow for easier differentiation between devices, device tags up to 45 characters long are now supported. Tag limitations are also dynamically shown as you enter the device tag - for example, an error message notifies you when you enter a tag 46 characters long. Back to release notes"

What new authentication protocol can you use to sync devices from VMware EMM in the 23.06 release?,The OAuth protocol,b6665ea6-ba87-4b06-b598-891abb8738dc,"Knox E-FOTA 23.06 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 23.06 OAuth authentication for VMware EMM Previously, you could sync devices from VMware EMM only using basic authentication. With the 23.06 release, you can also authenticate using the OAuth protocol. OAuth authentication requires a client ID and a client secret for successful EMM connection. Improvements to EMM group sync #Individually managed devices Previously, EMM groups controlled the behavior of synced devices and didn't allow you to individually manage these synced devices. This inability to manage devices individually forced you to unenroll the device from the group, even after the device was unsynced, making device management inconvenient for large fleets. With the 23.06 release, you can individually manage devices synced in EMM groups, without re-enrolling them. For example, if campaign A is assigned to devices in group A, you can now assign a few devices that are in group A to campaign B. Furthermore, for devices that are uploaded by EMMs, the Devices tab on the Devices page now lets you: Assign a campaign, create a campaign, Unassign a campaign, Unenroll devices, Force client refresh Additionally, you can click the EMM group name to access all the actions that you can perform on the Devices tab on the Devices page. #Default campaigns With the 23.06 release, when you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is assigned only to devices in the group when they are synced from the EMM for the first time. These synced devices exhibit the following properties: The default campaign associated with these devices changes if their EMM group or EMM group priority changes. Note that these devices won't be automatically assigned to the new default campaign. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you re-sync with the EMM. You can assign the default campaign to these devices, regardless of whether they were uploaded by a reseller or in bulk using a CSV file. You can find more information about the default campaign on the EMM groups page. Support for EMM group search With the 23.06 release, you can easily search EMM groups on the Manage EMM groups page and sync only the desired groups from the search results. Furthermore, you can individually sync each of these groups and filter the search results to display only the synced groups. You can search and add a maximum of 1,000 device groups without triggering a warning. UX enhancement to identify invalid firmware Starting with the 23.06 release, device firmware information displays a caution icon to help you determine whether a device listed on the Devices page is running invalid firmware. Support for dummy firmware in test campaigns Previously, the option to assign a test campaign to devices running dummy firmware wasn't available. This limitation persisted if you deleted or unenrolled such a device prior to reverting its firmware to regular firmware.

"What are the different device management modes available in Android for enterprises, and what are their key differences?","In Android for enterprises, there are different device management modes available, such as Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO), Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP), Separated Apps, Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C), and Work profile on personally-owned devices. The key differences between these modes include whether the device is company-owned or personally-owned, whether personal apps are allowed on the device, and the level of control that the enterprise has over the device",5512aefb-fed8-4223-afba-efaccdb535f9,"App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy.

What mechanism does Knox Attestation use to prevent replay attacks on device health measurements?,"Knox Attestation uses nonces, unique random numbers, to prevent replay attacks on device health measurements. These nonces are used to identify the measurements and protect against malicious actors trying to imitate or reuse them",44c7174c-8446-4773-88eb-3cbb8029cb4f,"Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used)."
How does Knox Attestation detect systemless rooting methods like Magisk that store system file modifications in the boot partition?,"Knox Attestation detects systemless rooting methods like Magisk that store system file modifications in the boot partition by uniquely signing attestation results and ensuring a chain of trust, using keys that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. It compares current device state with what is expected from a secure device and check for hardware fuses readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device",44c7174c-8446-4773-88eb-3cbb8029cb4f,"Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5.

How does Knox Vault provide protection against side-channel attacks compared to TrustZone?,"Knox Vault provides stronger protection against side-channel attacks compared to TrustZone because it runs independently from the primary processor that runs Android, making it resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources",299ac292-b64d-48ca-a007-857922705136,"Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy.

What feature allows enterprises to check device integrity on demand by reading TrustZone memory measurements?,Knox Attestatio,eef87115-4930-4106-84d4-ac0b9c3883dc,"Trusted Boot. Trusted Boot is a Knox Platform feature representative of Samsung's industry leading mobile device boot protection. Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late"
"According to the context, what happens if an unauthorized or outdated component is detected during Trusted Boot?","If an unauthorized or out-of-date component is detected during Trusted Boot, a tamper fuse is set, and sensitive work apps and data are permanently encrypted and inaccessible, since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated",eef87115-4930-4106-84d4-ac0b9c3883dc,"Trusted Boot.

Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late"
How does Knox Remote Control allow an IT admin to troubleshoot issues on a remote mobile device?,"Knox Remote Control enables IT admins to remotely view the device screen of the employee encountering a problem and take direct actions to solve the problem through finger, keyboard, and mouse events",ee5fc244-97c9-44e5-92d7-1b5a4139b20b,"Remote Control. With the increasing complexity of problems that IT admins must solve, Knox Remote Control provides IT admins a powerful way to quickly and remotely fix issues. Not only can IT admins have real-time access to what the remote device screen is displaying, but also control it by injecting actions such as finger, keyboard, and mouse events. Although other mobile platforms also offer remote viewing of remote device displays, only Knox provides built-in remote control of devices without requiring third-party solutions. Here is an example use case: An enterprise employee is on a business trip. On encountering a problem with the company-issued mobile phone, the employee contacts an enterprise IT""admin.

New features #Knox E-FOTA portal updates ##Pre-approved access to Knox E-FOTA Customers who have an activated Knox Configure or Knox Mobile Enrollment account are now pre-approved for access to Knox E-FOTA. That is, they do not need to apply for access to Knox E-FOTA; they can open the Knox E-FOTA portal by going to their SamsungKnox.com dashboard and clicking Launch on the Knox E-FOTA card. ##Closing the Knox E-FOTA client app The Knox E-FOTA client app can now be closed. In cases where the client app was recently used and the user closes all recent apps on the device, the error message Security policy restricts you from stopping this application no longer appears. When the client app is closed, it still communicates properly with the Knox E-FOTA server. For example, it still polls the server regularly and counts how many times an device user postpones an update. ##Default values during campaign creation Default values have been set on the campaign creation screen to minimize the number of clicks the user needs to make to create a campaign. ##Validation for the firmware installation period During campaign creation, values that are entered for the firmware installation period are now validated. The values entered are auto-corrected (if needed) to pass validation. The firmware installation period must be no shorter than 3 hours. ##Knox Manage login screen The URL of your Knox Manage admin portal is now required when connecting Knox E-FOTA to Knox Manage. #Knox E-FOTA client updates ##Automatic client app updates The Knox E-FOTA client app now checks for updates and automatically installs them (if available) whenever the app is launched. Solved issues #Knox E-FOTA portal ##Table customization Previously, when a user customized a table to add or remove columns, their changes were only applied to their current login session. The next time they logged in to the Knox E-FOTA admin portal, the table would have only the default columns. This has been resolved. A customized table now retains the columns the user has previously set. ##Displaying the firmware list for device model SM-T540 Previously, the Knox E-FOTA admin portal failed to display the firmware list for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active Pro (Wi-Fi) (SM-T540). This has been resolved.

What are two examples of use cases enabled by the UCM framework?,The UCM framework enables device lock Data at Rest (DAR) encryption,f9c72ea4-dad4-44cd-b04c-10fda693df43,"Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps."

How does Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) provide security for the kernel?,"RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. It prevents modification of kernel code and logic, critical kernel data structures, and kernel control flow. Kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements and is always active and requires no management control",2cd98ff5-c450-470e-b8ad-ca5cecbbf4d6,"Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP""prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP""prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP""prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM""protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: • SE for Android is enabled • SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments."

How does the Device Root Key (DRK) contribute to the Root of Trust on Samsung Knox devices?,"The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device",7516a19f-86a3-4e92-8502-f99a4cccdd1f,"Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)""to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM""of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)""can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK""encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK""is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK""is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA""but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle."

Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)""to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM""of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)""can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK""encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK""is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK""is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA""but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle."

In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details.

Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE.

Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone."

What new EMMs were added that allow you to connect Knox E-FOTA and manage devices?,"Support was added for the Blackberry and SOTI EMMs. You can now connect to Blackberry or SOTI through your Knox E-FOTA admin portal, select device groups to add, and perform operations on those devices",51a245f2-8ef3-4b7a-9969-d9cdb176bb3c,"Knox E-FOTA 1.32 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.32 For a full list of all features, visit the product page for Knox E-FOTA. Support for additional EMMs Support has been added for the Blackberry and SOTI EMMs. You can now connect to Blackberry or SOTI through your Knox E-FOTA admin portal, select device groups to add, and perform operations on those devices. #Support for Blackberry You can now add user groups from Blackberry. In Knox E-FOTA, these groups are treated as groups of devices, not groups of users. For information on how to get started on connecting Knox E-FOTA to Blackberry, see Prerequisites for connecting to Blackberry. Adding shared device groups from Blackberry is not supported at this time. #Support for SOTI You can now add device groups from SOTI. In SOTI, device groups can be arranged in hierarchies. That is, a device can belong to a group, and that group can in turn have a parent group. When you add a device from SOTI to Knox E-FOTA, you only get information about the device group that device directly belongs to. For information on how to get started on connecting Knox E-FOTA to SOTI, see Prerequisites for connecting to SOTI. Adding virtual device groups from SOTI is not supported at this time. Automatically pushing the latest firmware version of a particular OS To prevent security vulnerabilities, you can now configure a campaign such that it automatically pushes the latest firmware version of a particular OS to the assigned devices. When choosing the latest firmware, you can specify: Any - The latest firmware, regardless of its OS version, will be pushed to devices. Up to - The latest firmware, within a particular OS version, will be pushed to devices. If you select this, you may not receive security patches included in the latest firmware of the latest OS version. If no firmware that meets your criteria is available for devices of a particular model-carrier pair, an error is displayed. In this case, you can lock the devices to their current firmware version. Monitoring active campaigns through the Dashboard You can now check the operation status of active campaigns through the Dashboard. This allows you to easily get an overall view of how your campaigns are operating. When a campaign goes into Active state, a widget for it is automatically added to the Dashboard. You can hide that widget by clicking the X icon on it. You can also manually re-pin it to your Dashboard, as long as it's still in Active state. What data is provided regarding the active campaign? For each active campaign, the widget has two views. The Status view shows the following: Success rate , Successful - Count of devices that were successfully processed. This also includes devices that were not updated because they have a higher version than the target firmware. Attention - Count of devices that require your attention. That is, the update failed on these devices or triggered an error. When you click this, the Devices list is displayed, filtered to show the devices that need your action. In-progress - Count of devices that have yet to download or install updates. The Status view is updated in real time. The Trend view shows the success rate of the campaign over time. This view is updated once a day. Campaigns that were activated before this release will not have the trend view. Sharing a commercial license key between US and EU tenants A Super Admin can now use the same commercial license in two tenants - one US tenant and one EU tenant. This is helpful if they're syncing US and EU devices from Knox Manage to Knox E-FOTA. The US devices will be registered in the US tenant, and the EU devices will be registered in the EU tenant. That license key (registered in both tenants) can then be used to enroll the devices synced from the EMM. A license key can only be shared between 1 US tenant and 1 EU tenant. Preventing accidental unenrollment when syncing from an EMM Previously, if you had a device that was enrolled in Knox E-FOTA and you subsequently added a device group from your EMM that also contained that device, that device would lose its current status; it would get the initial status of the newly added group: Synced. The following policies have been added to avoid situations like this. 1. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then subsequently add its device group from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, that device will keep its current status until the EMM group's initial status changes from Synced to something else. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1. When you add Group 1 to Knox E-FOTA, it will get the status Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status. 2. When an EMM group's status changes from the initial Synced status into something else, all its members will follow the new status. Example: Continuing the example above - if you assign Group 1 to Campaign B, all its members, including Device A, will also be assigned to Campaign B. 3. If an EMM group is explicitly unenrolled, all its members will also be unenrolled. Example: Continuing the example above - if you unenroll Group 1, all its members, including Device A, will also be unenrolled. 4. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then subsequently add its device groups (multiple groups) from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, the device will follow the policy of the group with the higher priority. Group priority is set in Knox E-FOTA. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1 and Group 2. When you add Group 1 and Group 2 to Knox E-FOTA, they will both get the initial status, Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status (following the first policy above). In this example, Group 1 has a higher priority than Group 2, so Device A will follow Group 1's policy. If you enroll Group 2 and assign it to Campaign B, this change will not affect Device A. Since Group 1 is still in its initial Synced status, Device A will continue to retain its Assigned status. When you enroll Group 1 and assign it to Campaign C, Device A will also be assigned to Campaign C (following the second policy above). Change in number of seats in the Knox E-FOTA trial license Starting this release, the number of seats that come with a Knox E-FOTA trial license will change from 100 to 30. The trial keys of all Knox Cloud Services will have 30 seats for 3 months. Improvement in firmware download speed Firmware updates are now served through a content delivery network (CDN). This results in faster download speeds. Firmware notification emails temporarily stopped Knox E-FOTA has temporarily stopped sending firmware notification emails. We will enhance this feature and add it back at a later date. Client improvement An improvement was made in the way the Knox E-FOTA client app manages downloads of firmware updates. UX improvements The following enhancements to the user interface were made. #Devices with expired licenses The following enhancements were made for devices with an expired license: If an enrolled device's license expires, the device remains in Enrolled state. However, no campaign can be assigned to it. An icon and a tooltip will be visible explaining why the device cannot be enrolled. If a device is in Enrollment pending state and its license expires, the device's status changes to Failed to enroll. An error is logged for this event. #Permission exceptions When you attempt to perform an action that you don't have permission to perform, the admin portal will now display a clearly worded error message explaining that you don't have permission to perform that action. #Administrators & Roles In Administrators & Roles > Roles, a link to the Knox E-FOTA Admin Guide has been added. The page being referenced includes information on each role and its corresponding permissions. #Link to Knox E-FOTA page on managed Google Play To facilitate the deployment of the Knox E-FOTA app to devices through managed Google Play, the following button has been added in Devices > All Devices.

How does the new email preference feature allow users to configure their notifications?,"Users can now configure email preferences from the console, allowing them to disable the flags for all Knox E-FOTA-related emails if they don't want to receive them",866a61ad-1d59-4f06-b43a-e8e5a8bca8ff,"Knox E-FOTA 1.40 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.40 Support for email preferences Previously, users received all emails from the Knox E-FOTA tenant. Now in Knox E-FOTA 1.40, users can configure email preferences from the console. For example, if you don't want to receive emails from Knox E-FOTA, you can disable the flags for all Knox E-FOTA-related emails in Manage services & preferences > EMAIL PREFERENCES. Improved license assignment functionality As Knox E-FOTA uses Knox Suite licenses, license seats are shared across all Knox Suite services. As a result, the remaining seat count on the License details page may not be accurate. That is, you may be able to enroll more devices than the number of remaining seats shown. Prior to the Knox E-FOTA 1.40 release, you could only assign licenses to devices based on the remaining seat count displayed in License details. Now, an Assign license option is added to the Upload Devices menu in bulk actions and the Device tab to reflect the improved licensing behavior. With the new license assignment feature, you can select licenses for your devices to consume seats from. If you're assigning devices to a Knox Suite license that are already enrolled in other Knox cloud solutions using the same license, those devices do not consume additional seats. For example, if you have a Knox Suite key with 5 license seats and 5 devices are already enrolled in Knox Manage using that key, the remaining seat count is shown as 0 in Knox E-FOTA. However, you can still enroll those 5 devices in Knox E-FOTA as assigned seats can be reused with other Knox Suite services. Force client refresh for EMM group devices In Knox E-FOTA 1.40, the Force client refresh action is added to the EMM groups tab. Sending this command wipes current campaign info from the selected devices, updates the Knox E-FOTA client app, and syncs the latest campaign info. This feature is only available for devices that have the Knox E-FOTA client app installed - otherwise, it's disabled. See Push and poll for more details. Support for overnight firmware installation Previously, you could only set the firmware installation end time to a value greater than the start time, meaning some overnight time periods were unavailable for selection. You can now configure firmware to install overnight, spanning two days. For example, you might choose to have the installation take place from 10 pm to 2 am. Note that the installation period must be at least 3 hours long. Updated installation logic for the Knox E-FOTA client with Knox Configure Before KCS 1.40, if the Block applications from unknown sources feature was enabled in Knox Configure (KC), the Knox E-FOTA client could not be installed on the KC-managed devices. With this release, the installation logic is updated so the Knox E-FOTA client can automatically bypass the Block applications from unknown sources feature. Blocked FOTA installation before Knox E-FOTA enrollment In previous Knox E-FOTA versions, after out-of-the-box enrollment, end users could install FOTA (firmware-over-the-air) updates through a popup that took precedent over the Knox E-FOTA agent enrollment. Doing so prevented partner apps from working due to an OS mismatch. Now, the Knox enrollment service first checks whether the device is added to Knox E-FOTA console. If so, then the device is blocked FOTA updates before the device is enrolled to Knox E-FOTA console. Option to disable EMM group auto-sync Knox E-FOTA 1.40 adds an option to toggle auto-sync on and off on the EMM groups page. With this new feature, super admins can choose whether to automatically sync Knox E-FOTA with EMM group info after a pre-defined time interval. For more information, refer to Manage EMM groups. Improvements to device deletion in EMM groups Starting from Knox E-FOTA 1.40, devices in the console remain available even if they are deleted from their corresponding EMM groups or the EMM group is desynced. Only the device's group information is deleted, but the campaign, license, and upload source information is still accessible. This new behavior is to prevent accidental device deletion caused by issues with EMM group sync. Devices that were uploaded through an EMM can be deleted in the Devices tab or through a CSV upload. For devices that were uploaded through an EMM but are not associated with an EMM group, you cannot modify their license or campaign info. You must either reassign the device to an EMM group through EMM group sync, or delete and re-enroll the device. Back to release notes"

For devices that were uploaded through an EMM but are not associated with an EMM group, you cannot modify their license or campaign info. You must either reassign the device to an EMM group through EMM group sync, or delete and re-enroll the device. Back to release notes"
What is the new versioning system introduced in the Knox E-FOTA 21.11 release?,"Starting with this release, Knox product versioning will be named based on dates, specifically the year followed by the month. For example, the November 17, 2021 release uses 21.11 as the version name",975c6bcd-98a5-4254-ade0-d53e7ded1c9a,"Knox E-FOTA 21.11 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 21.11 Starting with this release, Knox product versioning will be named based on dates, specifically the year followed by the month. For example, this November 17, 2021 release - what would have been Knox cloud service 1.41 - uses 21.11 as the version name. End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Gradual campaign rollout This release allows you to randomly and gradually rollout campaigns to devices. You can rollout the campaign at a certain rate to a random set of devices daily. For example, 5% of the devices can start a firmware download on the first day, the next 5% on the day after, and so on. This feature helps with troubleshooting and discovering critical issues with firmware rollout and prevents the spread of bad firmware to all company devices, helping to maintain business continuity. The option to set a gradual campaign rollout is in campaign creation. Network throttling per Wi-Fi SSID With this release, you can now specify maximum download speeds for specific networks identified by SSID in your campaigns. This means you can throttle download speeds for up to five specific SSIDs and you can check which network is being used to download firmware to the devices assigned to the campaign. You can also see how many devices are using a specific SSID to download firmware on the dashboard. Detailed firmware information on device This release adds detailed firmware information in the firmware install ready pop-up notice. This gives more information such as improvements, firmware file size and security patch level about new firmware updates to the end user. Daily email reports for campaign updates With this release, you can subscribe to daily email updates reporting the number of updated devices and failures. These reports can help you better track devices that may need special attention with firmware updates. You can also see error details if the number of failed devices exceeds 20% of the total number of devices. Automatic re-assignment of license and campaign to EMM groups This release introduces automatic re-assignment of a license and campaign to devices in an EMM group which were not assigned. This feature prevents situations where devices in an EMM group are left unassigned because the default license did not have enough seats to hold all the devices in an EMM group. This process is done automatically after an EMM sync, and you can also trigger this process by re-assigning a license and campaign to EMM groups. USB Ethernet support With this release, devices can download firmware over a USB Ethernet connection. This feature allows you to download firmware on a large number of devices at high speeds without slowing down wireless networks. Ethernet connectivity is supported as long as the campaign allows Wi-Fi downloads. You can set this when creating or editing a campaign. Changes to client app deletion With this release, the Knox E-FOTA client app is no longer deleted from a device when it is unenrolled or deleted from Knox E-FOTA. You can uninstall the client app through your EMM, and an end user can still manually uninstall the client app after their device is unenrolled or deleted from Knox E-FOTA. This change removes the hassle of re-installing and launching the client app when re-registering the unenrolled devices. Changes to EMM group syncing This release limits the number of groups that can be added from an EMM instance to 1000. This change is to reduce server load and prevent loss of services. Improvements to campaign syncing In this release, the campaign information is synced only if the target firmware version of the device assigned to the campaign has changed. Syncing only when necessary reduces usage of resources and network loads. Back to release notes"

What feature helps prevent exploits that reuse existing kernel logic by protecting control flow?,Control Flow Protection (CFP,955e2e5d-a888-4f0d-b26f-6d6d3a910046,"Feature Summary. For those wanting a quick reference to the security, manageability, and advanced VPN""features offered by Samsung Knox devices, review the summary below. For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE""& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage ""invisible"" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT""to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT""can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE""can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption."

The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures"
What robust handling features does the Knox Platform provide for VPN tunnels during unexpected system events?,"The Knox Platform enhances VPN behavior by ensuring proper VPN behavior even during unexpected system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes.

Previously, an IT admin that signed up for Knox Suite needed to be approved for each Knox service separately. In this release, the onboarding workflow for some of the Knox services was consolidated to expedite the approval process. This allows IT admins to get started immediately on using the Knox services. The following scenarios demonstrate three possible Knox Suite onboarding workflows: Scenario 1 - You are not registered in any Knox service and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment are always approved together. That is, if you're approved for access to one of these, you're automatically approved to use the other. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 2 - You are already registered in a Knox cloud service (Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, or Knox Configure) and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You are automatically approved for access to Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 3 - You register for Knox Suite but are denied access to one of the Knox services 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You can still be approved for the other services that have not denied you access. Separate approval or rejection emails will be sent for the other services. 3. A Knox Suite trial license key is not generated. #Firmware notification emails Whenever a new firmware becomes available that is compatible to your registered devices, your Super Admins and Sub Admins, who have permission to manage the impacted devices, will receive an email notification. It contains the following details: Impacted device models (model and sales code pair), Firmware version, Security patch update, OS version, Details on what's new in the firmware In cases where multiple firmware deltas were added (for the same target version or for different target versions), only one email notification is sent. We encourage you to sign in to Knox E-FOTA to view and manage your firmware. Knox E-FOTA admin portal improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Accessing how-to videos related to Knox E-FOTA To facilitate learning about Knox E-FOTA, a link to Knox E-FOTA how-to videos has been added in the Feedback & Support tab of the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Syncing User groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage You can now sync user groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage. Previously, only device groups were supported. #Permission for Sub Admins to connect to or disconnect from an EMM Previously, only Super Admins had the permission to connect to an EMM or disconnect from it. Sub Admins can now perform this task. Thus, Super Admins and Sub Admins now have the same permissions with regard to managing Knox E-FOTA's integration with EMMs. #Admin portal UX improvements The following UX improvements were made on the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. ##Managing EMM groups The following improvements were made in the EMM groups tab: When managing EMM groups, all groups are now shown by default, including those you have not synced with Knox E-FOTA. This allows you to easily view and add other EMM groups. If you want to see only the groups you have already synced, select the Only show synced groups option above the EMM group list. The description in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen was improved. When no changes have been made in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen, the Update E-FOTA Groups button remains disabled. In the EMM groups tab, the possible statuses for each EMM group have changed as follows: Former status name , New status name - , - \- , Synced Not enrolled , Group not enrolled Enrolled , Group enrolled Group assigned , Group assigned \- , Expired , The Reconnect EMM option has been removed from the Action menu. When you disconnect the EMM from the Actions menu in the EMM groups tab, a popup appears, providing more descriptive information on how to unsync your synced groups and disconnect your EMM. A link to the Knox E-FOTA Admin Guide has been added to the Connect with your EMM screen. The documentation provides details on what you need to connect to your chosen EMM. ##Installing the Knox E-FOTA app through Knox Service Plugin To better educate admins on the many ways they can install the Knox E-FOTA client on devices, the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) button was added in Devices > All Devices. When clicked, the button launches a dialog box showing instructions on how to install the Knox E-FOTA client using an EMM that is set up with KSP. The dialog box also provides links to the following: Knox Service Plugin Admin Guide, How to set up KSP on different EMMs, How to configure your EMM to enable the installation of Knox E-FOTA through KSP Knox E-FOTA client improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA client app. #Enhancements in error messages shown during enrollment To improve the user experience during device enrollment, error messages displayed by the device during enrollment have been made more descriptive. #Checking for app updates To ensure that updates to the Knox E-FOTA client are immediately installed on devices, the client app will automatically check for updates in the following events: After enrollment. When the client gets a push update. When the device user taps Check for campaign updates. When the app is launched. After booting the device and recovering a network connection. At each periodic poll (heartbeat), which occurs 24 hours after the last poll. #Client UX improvements The following UX enhancements were made to the Knox E-FOTA client: When the client downloads a firmware update, the download progress is now displayed. When the device does not have an active Internet connection through Wi-Fi, a notification is shown on the app. When creating a campaign, the IT admin sets preconditions that must be met before a device can start installing an update. Previously, if a device did not meet these preconditions, the client would check again after 30 minutes. In this release, this 30-minute interval was changed to 1 hour. Campaign updates The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA campaigns. #Installation conditions and error messages When a firmware installation fails, the user is now notified of the reason. The following are possible reasons: The user triggered the installation at a time that is outside the firmware installation time frame specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required charging status specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required battery level specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required storage amount specified in the campaign. There is an incoming call. The firmware delta cannot be verified. #Local campaigns A local campaign is a firmware update that you deliver to your enterprise devices through your internal network. This allows you to reduce outgoing network load when pushing the campaign to devices. Local campaigns are useful when you expect devices to be in an environment with limited connectivity. ##Workflow The workflow to create local campaigns is as follows: 1. Request permission from Samsung to create local campaigns. When a Samsung admin grants you that permission, you can start working with local campaigns. 2. Create a local campaign, assign it to devices in Enrolled state in Knox E-FOTA, and select the target firmware to be deployed. When creating a local campaign, you specify the SFTP details of the local storage device that will host the firmware delta files. When the local campaign is created, the firmware deltas are sent to the local storage device. You will then receive an email containing the status of the file transmission, including the MD5 hash value of each delta file. 3. Copy the firmware deltas to the devices that need to be updated. 4. Use your EMM to create an intent that runs the firmware installation. Then, execute that intent. This causes the devices to start installing the firmware update. ##Unsupported operations The following operations are not supported: Assigning a local campaign to a device that is not in Enrolled state. Performing sequential updates. Only one delta update can be installed for each device in a local campaign. Assigning a local campaign to an EMM group. Setting a local campaign as a default campaign to be applied to devices uploaded by a reseller. Assigning a local campaign through a bulk action. Assigning a normal campaign to a device that has a local campaign assigned to it. Modifying the assigned devices in an active local campaign. Bug fixes The following bugs were resolved. #Syncing the status info of the client and server Enhancements were made to ensure that the server and client always show the same statuses. #Searching for the Knox E-FOTA app in Google Play Store on Wi-Fi-only devices Previously, Wi-Fi-only devices could not find the Knox E-FOTA app in the Google Play Store. This issue has been resolved. Back to release notes"

A Knox Suite trial license key is not generated. #Firmware notification emails Whenever a new firmware becomes available that is compatible to your registered devices, your Super Admins and Sub Admins, who have permission to manage the impacted devices, will receive an email notification. It contains the following details: Impacted device models (model and sales code pair), Firmware version, Security patch update, OS version, Details on what's new in the firmware In cases where multiple firmware deltas were added (for the same target version or for different target versions), only one email notification is sent. We encourage you to sign in to Knox E-FOTA to view and manage your firmware. Knox E-FOTA admin portal improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Accessing how-to videos related to Knox E-FOTA To facilitate learning about Knox E-FOTA, a link to Knox E-FOTA how-to videos has been added in the Feedback & Support tab of the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Syncing User groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage You can now sync user groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage. Previously, only device groups were supported. #Permission for Sub Admins to connect to or disconnect from an EMM Previously, only Super Admins had the permission to connect to an EMM or disconnect from it. Sub Admins can now perform this task. Thus, Super Admins and Sub Admins now have the same permissions with regard to managing Knox E-FOTA's integration with EMMs. #Admin portal UX improvements The following UX improvements were made on the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. ##Managing EMM groups The following improvements were made in the EMM groups tab: When managing EMM groups, all groups are now shown by default, including those you have not synced with Knox E-FOTA. This allows you to easily view and add other EMM groups. If you want to see only the groups you have already synced, select the Only show synced groups option above the EMM group list. The description in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen was improved. When no changes have been made in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen, the Update E-FOTA Groups button remains disabled. In the EMM groups tab, the possible statuses for each EMM group have changed as follows: Former status name , New status name - , - \- , Synced Not enrolled , Group not enrolled Enrolled , Group enrolled Group assigned , Group assigned \- , Expired , The Reconnect EMM option has been removed from the Action menu. When you disconnect the EMM from the Actions menu in the EMM groups tab, a popup appears, providing more descriptive information on how to unsync your synced groups and disconnect your EMM. A link to the Knox E-FOTA Admin Guide has been added to the Connect with your EMM screen. The documentation provides details on what you need to connect to your chosen EMM. ##Installing the Knox E-FOTA app through Knox Service Plugin To better educate admins on the many ways they can install the Knox E-FOTA client on devices, the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) button was added in Devices > All Devices. When clicked, the button launches a dialog box showing instructions on how to install the Knox E-FOTA client using an EMM that is set up with KSP. The dialog box also provides links to the following: Knox Service Plugin Admin Guide, How to set up KSP on different EMMs, How to configure your EMM to enable the installation of Knox E-FOTA through KSP Knox E-FOTA client improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA client app. #Enhancements in error messages shown during enrollment To improve the user experience during device enrollment, error messages displayed by the device during enrollment have been made more descriptive. #Checking for app updates To ensure that updates to the Knox E-FOTA client are immediately installed on devices, the client app will automatically check for updates in the following events: After enrollment. When the client gets a push update. When the device user taps Check for campaign updates. When the app is launched. After booting the device and recovering a network connection. At each periodic poll (heartbeat), which occurs 24 hours after the last poll. #Client UX improvements The following UX enhancements were made to the Knox E-FOTA client: When the client downloads a firmware update, the download progress is now displayed. When the device does not have an active Internet connection through Wi-Fi, a notification is shown on the app. When creating a campaign, the IT admin sets preconditions that must be met before a device can start installing an update. Previously, if a device did not meet these preconditions, the client would check again after 30 minutes. In this release, this 30-minute interval was changed to 1 hour. Campaign updates The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA campaigns. #Installation conditions and error messages When a firmware installation fails, the user is now notified of the reason. The following are possible reasons: The user triggered the installation at a time that is outside the firmware installation time frame specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required charging status specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required battery level specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required storage amount specified in the campaign. There is an incoming call. The firmware delta cannot be verified. #Local campaigns A local campaign is a firmware update that you deliver to your enterprise devices through your internal network. This allows you to reduce outgoing network load when pushing the campaign to devices. Local campaigns are useful when you expect devices to be in an environment with limited connectivity. ##Workflow The workflow to create local campaigns is as follows: 1. Request permission from Samsung to create local campaigns. When a Samsung admin grants you that permission, you can start working with local campaigns. 2. Create a local campaign, assign it to devices in Enrolled state in Knox E-FOTA, and select the target firmware to be deployed. When creating a local campaign, you specify the SFTP details of the local storage device that will host the firmware delta files. When the local campaign is created, the firmware deltas are sent to the local storage device. You will then receive an email containing the status of the file transmission, including the MD5 hash value of each delta file. 3. Copy the firmware deltas to the devices that need to be updated. 4. Use your EMM to create an intent that runs the firmware installation. Then, execute that intent. This causes the devices to start installing the firmware update. ##Unsupported operations The following operations are not supported: Assigning a local campaign to a device that is not in Enrolled state. Performing sequential updates. Only one delta update can be installed for each device in a local campaign. Assigning a local campaign to an EMM group. Setting a local campaign as a default campaign to be applied to devices uploaded by a reseller. Assigning a local campaign through a bulk action. Assigning a normal campaign to a device that has a local campaign assigned to it. Modifying the assigned devices in an active local campaign. Bug fixes The following bugs were resolved. #Syncing the status info of the client and server Enhancements were made to ensure that the server and client always show the same statuses. #Searching for the Knox E-FOTA app in Google Play Store on Wi-Fi-only devices Previously, Wi-Fi-only devices could not find the Knox E-FOTA app in the Google Play Store. This issue has been resolved. Back to release notes"

A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

What is the difference between a staggered license and a regular commercial Knox license?,"A staggered license allows devices to use a service for longer than the stated license expiration date, and has a service period which is longer than the activation period. Once the service period ends, the license can no longer be used. A regular commercial Knox license can only be used within the stated license expiration date",d2014704-717d-4f5d-83a6-bc2c8baafc84,"Knox licenses. Samsung offers a variety of Knox licenses to support your device management needs. If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

How does DualDAR encryption provide two separate layers of encryption to secure data on a mobile device?,"DualDAR encryption uses two layers of encryption, an outer and inner layer, to secure data on mobile devices. The outer layer of encryption is built on top of Android's FBE, while the innermost layer is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module, or an implementation provided by a third party. All data is encrypted by both layers",0aac4912-1249-4086-988c-4857fd1d1e85,"DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a""PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

What are the two protection modes Knox provides for Data-at-Rest?,The two protection modes Knox provides for Data-at-Rest are Protected and Sensitive,3227b41c-5d7f-4489-81aa-c16a415a8787,"Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP""meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP""is approved for use by the US""government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)""and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber."

For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber."

What capabilities does the Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) system developed by Samsung allow enterprises to control?,"The Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) system developed by Samsung allows enterprises to control device software updates by: selecting the highest firmware version allowed on devices, forcing a specific firmware version onto select devices, mass deploying a new firmware version, scheduling updates during non-peak work times, and strict control over user updates",11da46e1-b12b-4684-9450-8cba42af021f,"Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity.

What are some examples of biometric authentication methods mentioned in the passage?,"The passage mentions fingerprints, irises, and facial features as examples of biometric authentication methods",e56ef5d3-0c22-4688-8d03-2aee595ad237,"Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID""card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD""credentials to unlock a device or Work container.
