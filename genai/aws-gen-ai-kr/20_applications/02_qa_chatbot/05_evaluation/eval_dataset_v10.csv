What type of scanner does Knox Capture relate to in its functionality?,wedge scanne,30620de8-09b5-4d4e-9fc2-9cbd31a8e1a8,"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard"

What are the two ways to create a custom scanning profile according to the instructions?,"The two ways to create a custom scanning profile according to the instructions are:

1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options.
2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch",debaea23-ad2f-4e21-bc33-4ead2d7e8ab1,".

How do you open the app configuration dialog in most consoles?,"In most consoles, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal",8bb19e5e-85ab-4a8b-ad95-9efd3660036f,". 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console"
