      "Knox Capture works in a similar way to a wedge scanner, but as a software solution rather than physical hardware. Knox Capture acts as middleware that sits between a business application and the on-screen keyboard on a mobile device. When the user scans a barcode with Knox Capture, it translates the barcode data into keystrokes and inputs them into the business app, just like a wedge scanner would do. So Knox Capture emulates the functionality of a traditional hardware wedge scanner through a software app.\u001b[0m\n",
