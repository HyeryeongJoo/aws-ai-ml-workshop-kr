Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard.

Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter.
