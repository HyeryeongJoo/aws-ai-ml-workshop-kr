In the same way, Knox Capture reads barcode data from a mobile device, formats it, and sends it to a business app. So Knox Capture wedges between the data capture and the business app to integrate barcode scanning without needing an SDK in the app. The context says \"In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard.\"\u001b[0m\n",
