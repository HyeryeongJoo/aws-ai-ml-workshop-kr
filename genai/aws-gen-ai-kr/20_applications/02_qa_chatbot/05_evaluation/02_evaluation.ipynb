       "  Document(page_content=\"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 3, 'title': 'Overview', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/overview', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'id': '6d6fdcc9-799b-423d-ad90-648585bddfcb'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\". For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 29, 'title': 'Knox Capture v1.2 release notes', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/release-notes/v1-2', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26'}),\n",

Deploy configuration to EMM/UEM - Learn about the various scanning profile export options, and how to use the exported configuration file in an EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture to end-users.
