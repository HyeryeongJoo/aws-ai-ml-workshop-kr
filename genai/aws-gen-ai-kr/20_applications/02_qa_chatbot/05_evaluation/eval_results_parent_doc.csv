What is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture?,"Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. Therefore, a user cannot switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license, the app is exported in admin mode", Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture.,1,1,5,1.0,0.9999275207519531,1,5.501049757003784,"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default.

From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2.

Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file.

On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5.

- How can an IT admin configure camera scan triggers in Knox Capture?,"An IT admin can set camera scan triggers in Knox Capture by configuring an on-screen floating action button, a hardware button on the device, or both"," According to the context, an IT admin can configure camera scan triggers in Knox Capture in the following ways:

- Hardware scan trigger setting: IT admins can specify whether users can trigger camera scans using a hardware button on the device, an on-screen floating action button, or both. The hardware button options are the top button, bottom button, or side buttons on rugged devices like the XCover Pro. 

- Floating scan button: A new floating scan button is available in Knox Capture v1.2 that launches the camera for scanning when tapped. By default it appears at bottom right corner but users can move it around. IT admins can enable or disable this trigger.

- Keyboard scan icon: The on-screen Samsung keyboard displays a Knox Capture button that triggers the camera scanner when tapped. This is enabled by default if Samsung Keyboard is the default on the device.

The scan triggers can be configured from the Knox Capture home screen. IT admins can choose which triggers are enabled for users in both Admin and Managed modes.",1,4,5,0.25,0.9998999834060669,1,12.893136262893677,"Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",1040

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Videos. This section contains product and how-to videos related to Knox Capture. Getting started with Samsung Knox Capture In this video, we'll show you how to use Samsung Knox Capture to transform your mobile devices into powerful barcode scanners that can read, process, and output barcode data into other applications. Samsung Knox Capture: Enterprise-grade mobile scanning solution in Galaxy device This product intro video shows you how easy it is to transform rugged Samsung devices like the Galaxy XCover Pro into enterprise-grade barcode scanners.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode.

Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced.

How could an IT admin configure the Knox Capture interface to automatically append an Enter key event after scanning a barcode?,The IT admin could configure Knox Capture to automatically append an Enter key event after scanning a barcode by creating output rules that involve the Enter key," Based on the context provided, an IT admin could configure the Knox Capture interface to automatically append an Enter key event after scanning a barcode by:

Setting the Keystroke output rules in the scanning profile. The Keystroke output setting defines how barcode data is formatted after a successful scan. One of the formatting options is to append special characters like Tab or Enter at the end of the scanned data. This allows the data to be easily processed in spreadsheets and forms, as if the user tapped Enter on their keyboard after scanning. To enable this, the IT admin would navigate to the Keystroke output section when creating or editing a scanning profile. Then they would check the option to ""Append Enter after scan"". When this setting is enabled, an Enter key event will automatically be added to the end of each barcode scanned using that profile.",1,3,5,0.3333333333333333,0.9999268054962158,1,10.379013776779175,"Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.",43

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",570
- What is the intent key used to get the scanner type from the scanned data in Kotlin?,INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYP, Could not find answer in given contexts.,1,1,5,1.0,8.085491572273895e-05,0,6.350720167160034,"Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Use test mode. Check the scanning configuration by starting Knox Capture's system-wide test mode and launching a business app. Use test mode to visually confirm scan engine settings and keystroke output rules for each app in the configuration. Start test mode 1. Start test mode and open the Test configuration screen in one of the following ways: Tap the More actions menu icon next to the Profiles label on the home screen. Select Test apps. Tap the Share button in the lower-right of the home screen. Then, tap the Test configuration button in the Share configuration menu. 2. After starting test mode, look for a system pop-up notification indicating Test mode is on. Select an app to test 1. Either search for an app and tap the Open button next to it in the list on the Test apps screen, or exit Knox Capture and open the app. 2. Review the content of the blue test overlay in the open app's UI. The overlay displays: Activity - The name of the activity in focus. Active profile - The Knox Capture profile to which the in-focus activity belongs. This is the profile defining scan settings and keystroke output rules for the in-focus activity. Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers.

To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.",138
What feature allows device users to view the camera preview window and business app screen at the same time?,Scanner overla, Scanner overlay,1,1,5,1.0,0.9984158277511597,1,8.394068241119385,"Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off.

A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes",16

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

. Zoom factor Any value from 1.0 (no zoom) to 4.0 (fully zoomed in). Default value is 1.0. 2 Flashlight Auto is not available in Knox Capture: Scandit Edition.

Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters. ON/OFF OFF Double checksum mod n Uses and enforces a double checksum modulo n. ON/OFF OFF Remove leading zero Removes the leading zero digit from EAN13/UCPA scanned barcode data.

- What kind of templates does the AR software provide to help warehouse workers locate specific items?,The AR software provides search-and-find templates to help warehouse workers locate specific items," Based on the context provided, the AR software provides Search-and-find templates that help warehouse workers locate specific items. The Search-and-find template allows workers to scan a reference barcode of the item they are searching for, and then aims the camera at a wall of boxes to highlight the matching barcode when found.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9999277591705322,0,6.546844959259033,"AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters. ON/OFF OFF Double checksum mod n Uses and enforces a double checksum modulo n. ON/OFF OFF Remove leading zero Removes the leading zero digit from EAN13/UCPA scanned barcode data. ON/OFF ON Return as UPCA Transforms UPCE scanned barcode data into its UPCA representation

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

Use test mode. Check the scanning configuration by starting Knox Capture's system-wide test mode and launching a business app. Use test mode to visually confirm scan engine settings and keystroke output rules for each app in the configuration. Start test mode 1. Start test mode and open the Test configuration screen in one of the following ways: Tap the More actions menu icon next to the Profiles label on the home screen. Select Test apps. Tap the Share button in the lower-right of the home screen. Then, tap the Test configuration button in the Share configuration menu. 2. After starting test mode, look for a system pop-up notification indicating Test mode is on. Select an app to test 1. Either search for an app and tap the Open button next to it in the list on the Test apps screen, or exit Knox Capture and open the app. 2. Review the content of the blue test overlay in the open app's UI. The overlay displays: Activity - The name of the activity in focus. Active profile - The Knox Capture profile to which the in-focus activity belongs. This is the profile defining scan settings and keystroke output rules for the in-focus activity. Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay",145

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",346
What notification will the user receive if the IT admin has restricted the camera preview window?,The user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information, Could not find answer in given contexts.,1,1,5,1.0,7.619673851877451e-05,0,5.909134149551392,"Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit. Back to release notes

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.",41
How can managed mode be enforced on enterprise devices when using Knox Capture?,"To enforce managed mode on enterprise devices when using Knox Capture, one must deploy the application through an EMM console with Knox Capture configured. Following this, managed mode will be enabled automatically"," Based on the given context, managed mode can be enforced on enterprise devices when using Knox Capture by:

- Configuring and deploying Knox Capture through an EMM/UEM console. When Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console, managed mode is automatically applied.

- After an IT admin exports a scanning configuration file, they can deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices using their EMM/UEM. 

- To deploy with a configuration, the IT admin adds the scanning configuration file to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. This ensures devices install Knox Capture in managed mode.

- When deploying through an EMM, the admin should activate the license, assign the app to a group, launch the app configuration dialog, paste in the exported configuration, save settings, and deploy.

This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",1018

Knox Capture Scandit Edition. About this section Knox Capture Scandit Edition has all of the same functionality as the standard Samsung Knox Capture, however some of the scan engine settings and how licenses are managed differ slightly between the two versions. In this section, you'll find the procedures and workflows that are unique to Knox Capture Scandit Edition. For all other workflows, refer to the main document's how-to guide topics: Create scanning profiles, Configure keystroke output and data formatting, Configure apps and activities, Export and deploy configuration, Set scan trigger, Connect HW scanner, Configure output path, Use scanner overlay, Use test mode, Use intent output",380
- Why might barcode data not be outputting correctly to a business app?,There might be minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings," Based on the context, there are a few reasons why barcode data may not be outputting correctly to a business app:

- Minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. The recommendation is to use test mode to verify configurations after setting up a profile.

- On devices with a work profile running Android 11+, the text view is no longer automatically focused when scan data returns. To handle this, the Allow remote control policy must be enabled in the EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus. 

- When sending longer barcode data as key events, only part of the data may be seen in the business app. This is because after an internal timer counts down, Knox Capture assumes all data was delivered and switches focus back to the scanner overlay. Increasing the key event delay setting can help ensure all data is sent to the business app.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9941851496696472,1,19.03832983970642,"Barcode capture not working for business app. Overview You may encounter situations where barcode data is not outputting correctly to your business app. Why isn't barcode capture working for my business app? Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. Try using test mode to verify your configurations after setting up a profile.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Scan engine settings: Scandit. Knox Capture Scandit Edition has all of the same scan engine settings as Samsung Knox Capture.

ON/OFF , OFF , Extended barcode type settings Use these settings to configure each barcode type used in a Knox Capture profile. Access these settings by tapping Advanced settings near the bottom of the scan engine settings menu, then tap Extended barcode type settings to display a list of all barcode types. To view the settings menu for a particular barcode type, tap its name. The following table describes the possible barcode type settings that may appear: Setting Description Options Default Min. length Determines the minimum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters. ON/OFF OFF Double checksum mod n Uses and enforces a double checksum modulo n. ON/OFF OFF Remove leading zero Removes the leading zero digit from EAN13/UCPA scanned barcode data. ON/OFF ON Return as UPCA Transforms UPCE scanned barcode data into its UPCA representation",860

Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

There are two ways to override the Verizon PTT mapping: Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping, Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a single device before installing Knox Capture This procedure describes how to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a Verizon XCover Pro device. Perform this procedure before installing Knox Capture on the device. This procedure is useful if you're still in the process of testing Knox Capture on a device. If your goal is to configure a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices, see Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices instead. This procedure assumes that you haven't installed Knox Capture on the device. 1. On the device, tap Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key and switch off Verizon PTT. 2. Install Knox Capture. During installation, Knox Capture trigger is automatically assigned to the XCover key's Press action. You can verify this by going to Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key. Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices This procedure describes how to use your EMM to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on Verizon XCover Pro devices and program the XCover key to trigger a camera scan. In this procedure, Knox Manage is used to illustrate the steps, but the steps are similar for other EMMs. This procedure assumes you've set up the Knox Service Plugin app with your EMM and that Knox Capture is installed on the devices. 1. On your EMM console, open the Knox Service Plugin policies. To do this on the Knox Manage console, add or modify an Android Enterprise profile. Then, in the Samsung Knox policies, click Knox Service Plugin. For information on how to open the Knox Service Plugin policies on a different EMM, refer to that EMM's documentation. 2. Under Device-wide policies, set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Device Key Mapping (Premium), configure the mapping: 1. Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to True. 2. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to False. 3. For Package Name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. 4. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. 5. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 6. Set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to False. 4. Save and assign the configured profile to the Verizon XCover Pro devices. 5. Verify that the configuration was applied successfully: 1. On one of the devices, launch the KSP app and tap Apply policies. 2. Go to Settings > Advanced features and verify that the XCover Key is disabled (grayed out). Pressing the XCover key now triggers a camera scan.

. Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1. On the Knox Capture home screen, tap on the profile you want to set intent output for. 2. Under Intent output, tap Select app packages. 3. Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

How to prevent users from remapping the XCover key. Overview If you want to ensure device users can only use the XCover key to launch Knox Capture, you can apply a policy to prevent them from remapping it. How do I prevent users from remapping the XCover key? Disable XCover key remapping through your EMM: 1. Navigate to the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) section of your EMM. 2. Select Device-wide policies, then set Enable device policy controls to Enable. 3. Click Device Key Mapping (Premium), then configure the settings as follows: Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to Enable. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to Disable. For Package name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 4. Then, set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to Disable. 5. Save and apply the policies to your device. The XCover key can no longer be remapped on the device, which you can verify in the device's settings, under Advanced features. When the key is pressed, the Knox Capture camera launches as expected.

Set scan trigger. The camera scan trigger is a hardware key that, when pressed, launches the scanner from a business app. On rugged Samsung devices, the default scan trigger is the XCover key on the left side of the device. Admin mode 1. Next to the Profiles label on the home screen, tap the three dots to expand the more options menu. 2. Select Camera scan triggers. 3. Ensure Hardware key is turned on. 4. Tap either XCover key, Top key, or Side key double press to select the camera scan trigger. The available trigger options may vary based on the device you're using. To use Side key double press on supported devices, press the side key (formerly known as the Power or Bixby key) twice. 5. If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. 6. If you want to launch the scanner using a persistent button that stays on-screen, turn on Floating action button. By default, this button is turned off. Once enabled, you can hold and drag the button on the screen to move it, and it remains in the last place you moved it. To remove the icon, drag it to the ""Hide"" area at the top of the screen. It can be re-enabled in the Knox Capture app. Managed mode 1. From the home screen, ensure the Hardware key setting toggle is in the On position. 2. Tap either XCover key, Top key, or Side key double press to select the camera scan trigger. The available trigger options may vary based on the device you're using. To use Side key double press on supported devices, press the side key (formerly known as the Power or Bixby key) twice. 3. If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. Setting the camera scan trigger can be disabled in some instances, depending on device setup. For example, if the XCover Pro's top key has been mapped to an action unassociated with Knox Capture, the camera scan trigger may not be configurable.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity",49

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",603

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Manage licenses. Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so. Refer to our detailed walkthrough of the account set up process for more information. Once you have an account, do the following: 1. Apply for access to Knox Suite.

Refer to the Manage other licenses section of the Knox Admin Portal's how-to guide for a detailed walkthrough. 3. Once you generate your Knox Suite license, use the key to activate your Knox Capture license. Activate your Knox Capture license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: For IT admins using Knox Capture, the license can be activated through the License menu in the app. To allow end-users to fully use Knox Capture app in managed mode, the license must be activated through your EMM. #Through the License menu There are two options for activating a license through the License menu. ##Option 1: Enter license key manually 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting for your Knox Capture license key. After you enter the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. ##Option 2: Enter license by scanning a QR code To use this method, you'll first need to have a valid Knox Suite license key converted into QR code format. Once you have a QR code generated: 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the QR code button. A scanning window appears. 3. Aim the camera at the QR code, then tap Done to activate the license. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license.

Paste the key within the license field 3. Save the configuration. View remaining scans If you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key",41

"- How does Knox Capture work as a ""wedge"" between a software program and a mobile device's keyboard?","Knox Capture acts as a ""wedge"" between a software program and a mobile device's keyboard by ""wedging"" itself between the application's on-screen keyboard and the mobile device's camera. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan"," Based on the context provided, Knox Capture works as a ""wedge"" between a software program and a mobile device's keyboard in the following ways:

- Knox Capture is installed on a compatible Android smartphone or tablet. It acts as middleware that sits between business apps and the device's on-screen keyboard.

- When an end user launches their business app and taps a button to trigger a barcode scan, Knox Capture translates the scanned barcode data into keystrokes. 

- These keystrokes are then passed directly to the business app, as if the user had manually typed them using the on-screen keyboard. 

- From the business app's perspective, the keystrokes from Knox Capture appear exactly as if they came directly from the device's keyboard.

- So Knox Capture wedges between the business app and keyboard, scanning barcodes via the camera and then sending the data to the app in the form of simulated keystrokes. This eliminates the need to build scanning functionality directly into the app.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999253749847412,1,10.160847902297974,"Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",865

What scanning profile setting defines how barcodes are scanned and what happens to the data after each scan?,Scan engine settings," Based on the given context, the scan engine settings define how barcodes are scanned and what happens to the data after each scan. The scan engine settings allow configuring options such as:

- Barcode types to scan
- Scan mode (single or multi scan)  
- Scanner UI options like vibration, sound, and flashlight settings
- Rules for parsing and formatting the scanned data before sending it to the business app

The context mentions: ""Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan.""",1,4,5,0.25,0.9989805817604065,1,15.359611749649048,"Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Knox Capture AR - A feature introduced in Knox Capture v1.7 that provides important product information inside the camera preview window during a barcode scan. Learn what AR (Augmented Reality) is in Knox Capture, how to create AR templates, and how to use AR when performing barcode scans.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

What are the two configuration keys that need to be added to the app configuration dialog to enable the smartscan app to operate in managed mode?,"The two configuration keys are ""smartscan_license"" and ""smartscan_config"""," Based on the provided context, the two configuration keys that need to be added to the app configuration dialog to enable the smartscan app to operate in managed mode are:

smartscan_license - String - Knox license key 
smartscan_config - String - Exported configuration data from Knox Capture",1,1,5,1.0,0.9972894191741943,1,7.202715635299683,". Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Manage Scandit license. This section describes several methods to activate and deactivate your Knox Capture license. Get Knox Capture: Scandit Edition trial license If you're using Knox Capture: Scandit Edition, you need to sign in to the Knox Admin Portal in order to generate a trial license. If you don't already have access to the Knox Admin Portal, refer to the Sign up for Knox account page. Once you're in the Knox Admin Portal: 1. Go to Licenses > OTHER KNOX LICENSES > Manage license keys. 2. On the Other license keys page, click Actions > Generate Knox Capture Scandit Edition trial license key. 3. Use the LICENSE NUMBER to activate your Knox Capture trial on the device or through your EMM. Activate your license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: Through your EMM, Through the License menu #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field. Optionally include the scanning configuration as well. Refer to Deployment for more information. 3. Save the configuration. #Through the License menu The License menu only appears in Admin mode. To activate a license through the License menu: 1. On the home screen, tap the more actions icon, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting you to enter your Knox Capture license key. After you've entered the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. View remaining scans From Knox Capture v1.6 onwards, if you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can now view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",294
What is the default setting for prefix to data in Knox Capture?,Non, Could not find answer in given contexts. The context does not mention the default setting for prefix to data in Knox Capture.,1,4,5,0.25,0.00010855135769816115,0,9.24615478515625,"Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria. These rules convert scanned data into various formats, which are then passed to business apps through keystrokes. To create a rule and configure its actions and criteria: 1

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. Overview In Knox Capture, you may experience issues outputting scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. This issue affects Android 11 devices and is resolved on Android 12 and higher devices. Android 11, Chromium-based browsers, including: Samsung Internet , Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge Resolution If you are experiencing this issue, there are two resolutions and one workaround for scanning barcode data into HTML fields: Using the Advanced data formatting method, Using the Floating Action Button (FAB) method, Using another web browser as a workaround #Advanced data formatting method This method has been tested and confirmed working on the following device models running Android 11 with Knox Capture 1.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Use AR. The process for using a Knox Capture AR template to perform a barcode scan differs slightly depending if you're an IT admin or a device user. Launch AR templates #IT admins IT admins can launch an AR template by simply going to the AR templates screen and tapping Start scanning under the template of their choice. #End-users End-users can launch Knox Capture AR by doing the following: 1.

You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",247

To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",268
- What raw barcode data format is provided for inspection without any keystroke output rules applied?,- The scanned barcode data is in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied, Hexadecimal format,1,2,5,0.5,0.9969587326049805,1,5.913757085800171,". Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

For example, ""abc"" will appear as ""abc"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters get embedded in curly brackets. For example, a Tab control character will appear as """" in the test overlay if sent as a string. ##Key event Printable and non-printable characters appear in their character representation embedded in angle brackets when sent as key events. For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",19

Tap Done to save the settings. Connecting AR to a database server For customers who want to display important product details in the AR overlay every time a barcode is scanned, a connection between Knox Capture and the database server must first be set up

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

To view the settings menu for a particular barcode type, tap its name. The following table describes the possible barcode type settings that may appear: Setting Description Options Default Min. length Determines the minimum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily. Barcodes inside bitmaps can now be scanned. Barcode image localization is improved in difficult scanning situations, depending on the device or symbologies involved. Back to release notes

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",538
What setting can you configure to parse scanned barcode data based on the GS1 format before sending it to a target business app?,Enable GS1 parsing, Parse GS1,1,3,5,0.3333333333333333,0.9975035786628723,0,7.579816579818726,"Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",439

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",41

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",381

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode.

See Check a configuration in test mode to learn more.

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2.

New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes",424
What application store can Knox Capture be installed from for personal devices?,Knox Capture can be installed from the Play Store, Knox Capture can be installed from the Google Play Store for personal devices.,1,1,5,1.0,0.9997507929801941,1,5.228100776672363,"How do I install Knox Capture? . You can install Knox Capture from the Play Store. To install Knox Capture on multiple managed devices, use Managed Google Play in an EMM console. For more information on deploying and configuring Knox Capture across a device fleet, see Deployment.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file.

Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.",1019

How to trigger camera scan with XCover key on Verizon device. If your devices are enrolled as company-owned devices with work profiles, ensure that the Knox Service Plugin version in your EMM is 1.2.74 or higher before following the instructions below. Overview On Verizon XCover Pro devices, the XCover key is mapped to Verizon PTT (Push to Talk). This mapping prevents the device from triggering a camera scan when the user presses that key. How do I set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a Verizon XCover Pro device? There are two ways to override the Verizon PTT mapping: Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping, Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a single device before installing Knox Capture This procedure describes how to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a Verizon XCover Pro device. Perform this procedure before installing Knox Capture on the device. This procedure is useful if you're still in the process of testing Knox Capture on a device. If your goal is to configure a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices, see Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices instead. This procedure assumes that you haven't installed Knox Capture on the device. 1. On the device, tap Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key and switch off Verizon PTT. 2. Install Knox Capture. During installation, Knox Capture trigger is automatically assigned to the XCover key's Press action. You can verify this by going to Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key. Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices This procedure describes how to use your EMM to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on Verizon XCover Pro devices and program the XCover key to trigger a camera scan. In this procedure, Knox Manage is used to illustrate the steps, but the steps are similar for other EMMs. This procedure assumes you've set up the Knox Service Plugin app with your EMM and that Knox Capture is installed on the devices. 1. On your EMM console, open the Knox Service Plugin policies. To do this on the Knox Manage console, add or modify an Android Enterprise profile. Then, in the Samsung Knox policies, click Knox Service Plugin. For information on how to open the Knox Service Plugin policies on a different EMM, refer to that EMM's documentation. 2. Under Device-wide policies, set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Device Key Mapping (Premium), configure the mapping: 1. Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to True. 2. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to False. 3. For Package Name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. 4. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. 5. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 6. Set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to False. 4. Save and assign the configured profile to the Verizon XCover Pro devices. 5. Verify that the configuration was applied successfully: 1. On one of the devices, launch the KSP app and tap Apply policies. 2. Go to Settings > Advanced features and verify that the XCover Key is disabled (grayed out). Pressing the XCover key now triggers a camera scan.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.",903

Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",286

- How can Knox Capture be used to transform Samsung mobile devices into barcode scanners?,"Knox Capture can be used to transform Samsung mobile devices into barcode scanners by allowing them to read, process, and output barcode data into other applications"," Based on the provided context, here is the summary of how Knox Capture can be used to transform Samsung mobile devices into barcode scanners:

Knox Capture is an Android solution that allows enterprise IT admins to turn compatible Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets into barcode scanners. It works by acting as a 'wedge' between a business application and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. 

When an end user launches their business app, they can tap a button to trigger the camera to scan a barcode. Knox Capture then translates the barcode data into keystrokes which get passed back to the business app, appearing as if they were manually typed on the keyboard.

To configure the scanning behavior, IT admins create 'scanning profiles' in Knox Capture. These profiles define which apps can trigger scanning, what barcode types are supported, how the scanned data gets formatted before sending to apps, and other scanner settings.

The default profile allows scanning with any app, but custom profiles can restrict scanning to only approved business apps. Profiles get deployed to end user devices through an EMM/MDM solution.

In summary, by installing Knox Capture and configuring scanning profiles, Samsung mobile devices can be transformed into enterprise-grade barcode scanners tailored for business apps, without needing any additional hardware.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9998156428337097,1,22.867526292800903,"Videos. This section contains product and how-to videos related to Knox Capture. Getting started with Samsung Knox Capture In this video, we'll show you how to use Samsung Knox Capture to transform your mobile devices into powerful barcode scanners that can read, process, and output barcode data into other applications. Samsung Knox Capture: Enterprise-grade mobile scanning solution in Galaxy device This product intro video shows you how easy it is to transform rugged Samsung devices like the Galaxy XCover Pro into enterprise-grade barcode scanners.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",1363

See Check a configuration in test mode to learn more.

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit. Back to release notes

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

How can Knox Capture send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device such as a PC?,"Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions"," Based on the given context, Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device like a PC by:

1. Enabling the Bluetooth wedge option under Output path in the Knox Capture settings. 

2. Making the Knox Capture device discoverable under Paired devices.

3. Selecting the PC or other Bluetooth device to pair with from the list of available devices. 

4. Once paired, any scanned data will be sent to the connected PC or device through Bluetooth, with Knox Capture acting as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9999157190322876,1,8.835330247879028,"Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Connect HW scanner. Before performing the following steps, ensure the Hardware scanner option under Scanner is enabled in your scanning profile. For Bluetooth scanners 1. On the Knox Capture main page, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Connect scanner. 3. On the Connect scanner screen, select Pair new device. 4. If Bluetooth is turned off, you're prompted to turn it on. Afterwards, the Bluetooth connection panel appears. You can use this panel to connect to the scanner or navigate to the device settings to connect. 5. A pop-up then appears asking the user to confirm whether they want to use the paired device for scanning with Knox Capture. Select Yes. If you close the pop-up without confirming, you must unpair and re-pair the scanner before you can use it with Knox Capture. To remove a Bluetooth scanner, tap the gear icon next to the scanner and select Remove as a scanner. If you don't want to see the scan confirmation pop-up from Knox Capture again, select Unpair instead. For USB scanners 1. Launch the Knox Capture application, then simply plug in your USB scanner. 2. When the New Device Connected pop-up displays, tap Yes to allow your device to connect to the scanner. You'll be automatically taken to the Connect scanner screen. If you close the pop-up without confirming, you must disconnect and reconnect the scanner before you can use it with Knox Capture. 3. To remove a paired USB scanner, on the Connect scanner screen, go to Connected devices, then tap the gear icon next to the scanner and select Remove as a scanner. Test a scanner You can also test your scanner in Test mode. If any app has the Hardware scanner setting enabled, the Test apps screen shows your connected scanners under the apps. If no hardware scanner is connected, the blue test overlay displays ""Data source: No device connected"". This message is not shown if a data source is identified or a hardware scanner is connected. See Check a configuration in test mode to learn more.

Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",11

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",422

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Set scan trigger. The camera scan trigger is a hardware key that, when pressed, launches the scanner from a business app. On rugged Samsung devices, the default scan trigger is the XCover key on the left side of the device. Admin mode 1. Next to the Profiles label on the home screen, tap the three dots to expand the more options menu. 2. Select Camera scan triggers. 3. Ensure Hardware key is turned on. 4. Tap either XCover key, Top key, or Side key double press to select the camera scan trigger. The available trigger options may vary based on the device you're using. To use Side key double press on supported devices, press the side key (formerly known as the Power or Bixby key) twice. 5. If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. 6. If you want to launch the scanner using a persistent button that stays on-screen, turn on Floating action button. By default, this button is turned off. Once enabled, you can hold and drag the button on the screen to move it, and it remains in the last place you moved it. To remove the icon, drag it to the ""Hide"" area at the top of the screen. It can be re-enabled in the Knox Capture app. Managed mode 1. From the home screen, ensure the Hardware key setting toggle is in the On position. 2. Tap either XCover key, Top key, or Side key double press to select the camera scan trigger. The available trigger options may vary based on the device you're using.

If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. Setting the camera scan trigger can be disabled in some instances, depending on device setup. For example, if the XCover Pro's top key has been mapped to an action unassociated with Knox Capture, the camera scan trigger may not be configurable.",482
"According to the context, can IT admins make changes to the default scanning profile's apps and activities behavior? Explain.","No, IT admins cannot change the default scanning profile's apps and activities behavior. They must use a custom profile if they wish to control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan"," According to the context, IT admins cannot change the default scanning profile's apps and activities behavior. The context mentions:

""When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner.""

So while IT admins can modify some settings in the default profile like appending a Tab key, they cannot change the apps and activities that trigger the scanner when using the default profile. The apps and activities can only be customized in custom profiles created separately.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999047517776489,0,12.833511114120483,". If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.",940
How can you ensure all devices with your app operate in Managed mode when new devices are added without an existing configuration?,"To ensure all devices operate in the same mode, the newly introduced devices need to be provided with the configuration without fail. This mandatory configuration inclusion can be done either through the exported configuration or through the app's shared configuration"," After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode.",1,1,5,1.0,0.02229543961584568,0,6.986351013183594,"Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices . Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console. For details on deploying the app in Managed mode, see Deployment.

Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",286

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",440
How does Knox Capture indicate when a configuration file is too large to fit in a single QR code?,Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file," Based on the context, if the configuration file is too large to fit in a single QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan all the QR codes before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9995625615119934,1,7.177516937255859,". Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

For more information on license activation, refer to Activate your license. For more information on configuring the app in the EMM console, refer to Deployment.

Do I need a license to start using Knox Capture? . No license is required to try Knox Capture. To try it for free, download the app from Google Play and configure scan settings according to the IT admins: Get started tutorial. The free version of the app provides up to 100 scans per device.",645
How can a business app programmatically obtain scanned data from Knox Capture?,"Business app developers must edit the AndroidManifest.xml file to set up Knox Capture to send the correct intent output, while Knox Capture admins must configure Intent output feature accordingly"," Here are the key points on how a business app can programmatically obtain scanned data from Knox Capture:

- The business app developer needs to edit the AndroidManifest.xml file to define the package name, intent action and category that Knox Capture should use to send the data.

- Knox Capture offers three different methods for the app to receive the intent - using an activity, a foreground service, or a broadcast receiver. The manifest needs to be configured accordingly. 

- The intent sent by Knox Capture contains key information like test mode status, a list of scanned bundles, and the bundle structure.

- The business app needs to get and read the data from the intent to obtain the scanned information. A code snippet demonstrates how to do this in Kotlin.

- The Knox Capture IT admin must configure the intent output settings to match what is defined in the AndroidManifest.xml of the business app. For example, specifying the same package name and intent delivery method.

- An example shows how the admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity in the business app.",1,4,5,0.25,0.9989004135131836,0,15.991751670837402,"Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",1130
What key/value pair contains information about whether test mode is active for Knox Capture?,ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MOD," Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode""

If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit. Back to release notes

Use test mode. Check the scanning configuration by starting Knox Capture's system-wide test mode and launching a business app. Use test mode to visually confirm scan engine settings and keystroke output rules for each app in the configuration. Start test mode 1. Start test mode and open the Test configuration screen in one of the following ways: Tap the More actions menu icon next to the Profiles label on the home screen. Select Test apps. Tap the Share button in the lower-right of the home screen. Then, tap the Test configuration button in the Share configuration menu. 2. After starting test mode, look for a system pop-up notification indicating Test mode is on. Select an app to test 1. Either search for an app and tap the Open button next to it in the list on the Test apps screen, or exit Knox Capture and open the app. 2. Review the content of the blue test overlay in the open app's UI. The overlay displays: Activity - The name of the activity in focus. Active profile - The Knox Capture profile to which the in-focus activity belongs. This is the profile defining scan settings and keystroke output rules for the in-focus activity. Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay

"According to the passage, how can users reposition and resize the scanner overlay when they first launch it?",Users can reposition and resize the scanner overlay when they first launch it by following the instructions in the on-screen tutorial," According to the passage, when users launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. The passage states:

""When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay.""",1,1,5,1.0,0.9996936321258545,1,4.832188606262207,"Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit. Back to release notes

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity",234

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.",868

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Configure AR. Refer to the following instructions for creating Knox Capture AR templates. Configure Search-and-find template To create an AR template that allows users to search for a reference barcode: 1. Tap the menu button (three vertical dots) next to the search icon on the Knox Capture home screen, then select Augmented reality > Configure AR. 2. On the template selection screen, tap Search and find. 3. In AR overlay settings, give your template a name and provide an _optional_ Template URL. The Template URL field is used if you want to connect Knox Capture AR to you product database in order to display additional product information whenever a reference barcode is located. See Connecting AR to a database server for more information. 4. In Barcode types, select the barcode technologies that you want Knox Capture AR to scan. 5. Tap Continue to save your template. If you entered a database server address in the Tempalte URL field, you'll be taken to the AR overlay field selection screen. See Customize AR overlay information to learn more. If you left the URL field empty, you'll be taken to the AR templates screen. Configure View-and-update template To create an AR template that allows users to view product information and make updates to a database after each barcode scan: 1. Tap the menu buton (three vertical dots) next to the search icon on the Knox Capture home screen, then select Augmented reality > Configure AR. 2. On the template selection screen, tap View and update. 3. In AR overlay settings, give your template a name and provide your database server address in the Template URL field. This field is _mandatory_, and it allows Knox Capture AR to connect to your database in order to view and update product information during each barcode scan. See Connecting AR to a database server for more information. 4. In Barcode types, select the barcode technologies that you want Knox Capture AR to scan. 5. Tap Continue to save your template. You'll be taken to the AR overlay field selection screen. See Customize AR overlay information to learn more. Customize AR overlay information After you connect Knox Capture AR to a product database server, the AR overlay can display important product information on-screen whenever a barcode is scanned. This information is presented in a pop-up above the barcode, and contains the following: Title - This is the main text that appears in the pop-up whenever a barcode is scanned. Image - This image appears as a thumbnail in the pop-up, and as a larger image in the product details whenever the user taps the > button. Fields - This information appears in the the product details after the user taps the > button. To configure the AR overlay information: 1. On the AR templates screen, find the template that you want to customize and tap the menu button (three vertical dots), then tap Edit. 2. In Title, select the data that you want to display as the main title in the pop-up. 3. In Image, select how you want the image to appear - whether a thumbnail or full size image - when the user expands the Product details. Note that this step affects the image in the product details. The thumbnail image always appears in the pop-up, regardless of the size you select. 4. In Fields, select the information that appears when the user the > button to expand the product details in the pop-up. For View-and-update AR templates, admins can specify which fields can be updated by the user by tapping the edit icon (pencil) next to a field name. The edit icon turns blue to indicate fields that can be overwritten. Note that fields only display the edit icon if they were given WRITE permissions in the database. 5. Tap Done to save the settings. Connecting AR to a database server For customers who want to display important product details in the AR overlay every time a barcode is scanned, a connection between Knox Capture and the database server must first be set up

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

What setting controls whether the scan engine parses barcode data according to the GS1 standard before sending it to the target business app?,"Parse GS1
If enabled, parses scanned barcode data based on the GS1 data format before sending it to the target business app", Parse GS1,1,5,5,0.2,0.9871361255645752,1,9.189232587814331,"Barcode capture not working for business app. Overview You may encounter situations where barcode data is not outputting correctly to your business app. Why isn't barcode capture working for my business app? Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. Try using test mode to verify your configurations after setting up a profile.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button.

To view the settings menu for a particular barcode type, tap its name. The following table describes the possible barcode type settings that may appear: Setting Description Options Default Min. length Determines the minimum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM.

Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes",222
- What new feature allows IT admins to enable or disable the default profile in Knox Capture?,Knox Capture main page, Could not find answer in given contexts.,1,2,5,0.5,8.082006388576701e-05,0,6.630219459533691,"Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",41
How does the new Knox Capture version support exporting larger configurations through multiple QR codes?,This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. IT admins can generate multiple QR codes in a PDF file for the end user to scan," Based on the provided context:

Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1.

Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

- What new scanner feature is available in Knox Capture v1.5?,"- A scanner overlay is available.
- Continuous scanning for single scan mode"," Scanner overlay

Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9367095828056335,0,7.893411874771118,"Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.9 release notes.

Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground.

In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",17
"- What type of barcodes might Knox Capture have trouble scanning if they are too small, according to the context?",Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically," Based on the context, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes that are too small. The context mentions:

""For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenever possible to increase the success rate of scans.""",1,2,5,0.5,0.9881420731544495,1,8.779307126998901,"Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan.

Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.",824

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default.

- Why is Knox Capture called a wedge?,"Knox Capture is called a wedge barcode scanner because it acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data"," Knox Capture is called a wedge because it works similarly to a wedge barcode scanner - a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer to translate barcode data into keystrokes. 

Specifically, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by a mobile device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and sends it to a business app. From the app's perspective, the data appears as if it was typed manually using the device's keyboard. 

Knox Capture wedges between the business app and the keyboard to translate barcode scans into keystrokes, without requiring additional hardware or writing code. This allows users to turn their mobile devices into barcode scanners to capture and input data into business apps.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9999191761016846,1,18.293651342391968,"Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. Setting the camera scan trigger can be disabled in some instances, depending on device setup. For example, if the XCover Pro's top key has been mapped to an action unassociated with Knox Capture, the camera scan trigger may not be configurable.

How to trigger camera scan with XCover key on Verizon device. If your devices are enrolled as company-owned devices with work profiles, ensure that the Knox Service Plugin version in your EMM is 1.2.74 or higher before following the instructions below. Overview On Verizon XCover Pro devices, the XCover key is mapped to Verizon PTT (Push to Talk). This mapping prevents the device from triggering a camera scan when the user presses that key. How do I set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a Verizon XCover Pro device? There are two ways to override the Verizon PTT mapping: Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping, Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a single device before installing Knox Capture This procedure describes how to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a Verizon XCover Pro device. Perform this procedure before installing Knox Capture on the device. This procedure is useful if you're still in the process of testing Knox Capture on a device. If your goal is to configure a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices, see Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices instead. This procedure assumes that you haven't installed Knox Capture on the device. 1. On the device, tap Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key and switch off Verizon PTT. 2. Install Knox Capture. During installation, Knox Capture trigger is automatically assigned to the XCover key's Press action. You can verify this by going to Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key. Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices This procedure describes how to use your EMM to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on Verizon XCover Pro devices and program the XCover key to trigger a camera scan. In this procedure, Knox Manage is used to illustrate the steps, but the steps are similar for other EMMs. This procedure assumes you've set up the Knox Service Plugin app with your EMM and that Knox Capture is installed on the devices. 1. On your EMM console, open the Knox Service Plugin policies. To do this on the Knox Manage console, add or modify an Android Enterprise profile. Then, in the Samsung Knox policies, click Knox Service Plugin. For information on how to open the Knox Service Plugin policies on a different EMM, refer to that EMM's documentation. 2. Under Device-wide policies, set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Device Key Mapping (Premium), configure the mapping: 1. Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to True. 2. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to False. 3. For Package Name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. 4. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. 5. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 6. Set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to False. 4. Save and assign the configured profile to the Verizon XCover Pro devices. 5. Verify that the configuration was applied successfully: 1. On one of the devices, launch the KSP app and tap Apply policies. 2. Go to Settings > Advanced features and verify that the XCover Key is disabled (grayed out). Pressing the XCover key now triggers a camera scan.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app.",1,2,5,0.5,0.0020425296388566494,0,6.415712356567383,"Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",326

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.3 release notes. Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat. #By uninstalling the Knox Capture app To manually deactivate the license seat for a device, simply uninstall the Knox Capture app. The license agent then releases the associated seat for usage.

Paste the key within the license field. Optionally include the scanning configuration as well. Refer to Deployment for more information. 3. Save the configuration. #Through the License menu The License menu only appears in Admin mode. To activate a license through the License menu: 1. On the home screen, tap the more actions icon, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting you to enter your Knox Capture license key. After you've entered the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. View remaining scans From Knox Capture v1.6 onwards, if you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can now view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.",257

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. Overview In Knox Capture, you may experience issues outputting scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. This issue affects Android 11 devices and is resolved on Android 12 and higher devices. Android 11, Chromium-based browsers, including: Samsung Internet , Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge Resolution If you are experiencing this issue, there are two resolutions and one workaround for scanning barcode data into HTML fields: Using the Advanced data formatting method, Using the Floating Action Button (FAB) method, Using another web browser as a workaround #Advanced data formatting method This method has been tested and confirmed working on the following device models running Android 11 with Knox Capture 1.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Manage licenses. Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use.

- What is a wedge scanner and how does it relate to the Knox Capture solution?,"A wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches to a computer and sends data as keystrokes from a software program. 

In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard"," A wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. 

In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999216794967651,1,14.385339498519897,"Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser.

In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",234

New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied",518
What are the 3 steps outlined in the context for setting up and customizing a default scanning profile?,"1. Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings.

For example, enable the Append Enter character option.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999033212661743,1,17.402666807174683,"Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",1096

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.",836

Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data.

For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied",325

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.",532

Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",401

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",38

If you want to be able to launch the scanner from your keyboard, go to your device settings and set the Samsung Keyboard as default. Setting the camera scan trigger can be disabled in some instances, depending on device setup. For example, if the XCover Pro's top key has been mapped to an action unassociated with Knox Capture, the camera scan trigger may not be configurable.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning.

The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes",444

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",391

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied",479

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

. Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1. On the Knox Capture home screen, tap on the profile you want to set intent output for. 2. Under Intent output, tap Select app packages. 3. Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.",78

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.",264

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. Overview In Knox Capture, you may experience issues outputting scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. This issue affects Android 11 devices and is resolved on Android 12 and higher devices. Android 11, Chromium-based browsers, including: Samsung Internet , Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge Resolution If you are experiencing this issue, there are two resolutions and one workaround for scanning barcode data into HTML fields: Using the Advanced data formatting method, Using the Floating Action Button (FAB) method, Using another web browser as a workaround #Advanced data formatting method This method has been tested and confirmed working on the following device models running Android 11 with Knox Capture 1.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

Knox Capture v1.3 release notes. Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",130

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button.

This indicates that the data is using ASCII encoding, with ASCII control characters represented by escape sequences.",1,1,5,1.0,0.0037597673945128918,0,6.89361834526062,"Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code.

ON/OFF , OFF , Extended barcode type settings Use these settings to configure each barcode type used in a Knox Capture profile. Access these settings by tapping Advanced settings near the bottom of the scan engine settings menu, then tap Extended barcode type settings to display a list of all barcode types. To view the settings menu for a particular barcode type, tap its name. The following table describes the possible barcode type settings that may appear: Setting Description Options Default Min. length Determines the minimum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters. ON/OFF OFF Double checksum mod n Uses and enforces a double checksum modulo n. ON/OFF OFF Remove leading zero Removes the leading zero digit from EAN13/UCPA scanned barcode data. ON/OFF ON Return as UPCA Transforms UPCE scanned barcode data into its UPCA representation

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Zoom factor Any value from 1.0 (no zoom) to 4.0 (fully zoomed in). Default value is 1.0. 2 Flashlight Auto is not available in Knox Capture: Scandit Edition. Barcode highlighting Refer to the following settings to change the camera UI overlay displaying around recognized barcodes when scanning: Setting , Description - , - Fill color , Set the color inside the box highlighting a recognized barcode, represented as ARGB in HEX format. Set to 00000000 (transparent) by default. Stroke color , Set the border color of the box highlighting the recognized barcode, represented as ARGB in HEX format. Set to FF1C7980 by default. Stroke width , Set the border width of the box highlighting the recognized barcode in pixels. Set to 3 pixels by default. Advanced settings #Extended barcode type settings Use these settings to configure each barcode type used in a Knox Capture profile. Access these settings by tapping Advanced settings near the bottom of the scan engine settings menu, then tap Extended barcode type settings to display a list of all barcode types. To view the extended settings for a particular barcode type, tap its name. The following table describes the possible barcode type settings that may appear: Setting Options Inverted color recognition Off (default) On #Barcode filtering Use the following settings to conditionally validate barcodes and highlight rejected barcodes: Setting , Options - , - Custom validation , Set a regular expression (regex) used to filter scanned barcodes. Only barcodes that match the provided regular expression will be accepted. Refer to this reference for details on crafting an expression. By default, no regex is set. Highlight rejected code , Toggle on to enable an overlay in the camera preview window that appears around rejected codes. A Custom validation value must be set to enable this setting. This is toggled Off by default. #Visual cue The visual cue is the viewfinder overlay centered in the camera scanning UI that focuses the user's attention on a barcode. The size of the visual cue is the same size as of the actual scan area. Setting Options View finder selection Rectangular (default) &mdash; Draws a rectangle around detected barcodes. Laser &mdash; Overlays a horizontal ""laser"" line over detected barcodes. Rectangular viewfinder width Set the width of the rectangular viewfinder, specified in screen width percentage. Only active if View finder selection is set to Rectangular. Available values are 0% to 100%. Default value is 90%. Rectangular viewfinder height Set the height of the rectangular viewfinder specified in screen height percentage. Only active if View finder selection is set to Rectangular.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced.

Manage licenses.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Demo AR. As an IT admin, you can demo the Knox Capture AR features without having to set up a real server or go through any profile configuration or setup process. AR demo mode only supports the View-and-update template. To learn more about templates, see AR overview. Before you begin Before you can demo the AR features, you'll first need to display the Knox Capture demo AR barcodes on a screen. To do this, simply open the demo AR barcodes page on a computer or separate mobile device, then scan these barcodes to test the AR features. View demo AR barcodes. Try AR demo mode Once you have the sample barcodes available, you can demo the AR features. To do this: 1. Go to the Knox Capture app's home screen, then tap the options menu button and select Knox Capture AR. 2. On the Knox Capture Augmented Reality screen, tap Demo AR, then tap Start. 3. On the next screen, tap Continue. You can demo the AR features up to a maximum of five times per device. 4. Open the AR demo barcodes. 5. Aim your camera at one or more sample barcodes, then tap Freeze to show the product information in the overlay. 6. Tap > to view the full product details and make updates to the Stock count, then tap Save. The updated stock count updates in the AR overlay. 7. Tap Done to exit AR demo mode.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.3 release notes. Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily. Barcodes inside bitmaps can now be scanned. Barcode image localization is improved in difficult scanning situations, depending on the device or symbologies involved. Back to release notes",128

Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7.

Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5.

Can you explain how an end-user can launch the barcode scanner from the Knox Capture app?,An end-user can launch the barcode scanner from the Knox Capture app by tapping the Knox Capture button on the home screen," Here are the steps an end-user can take to launch the barcode scanner from the Knox Capture app, based on the provided context:

First, open the app you want to scan into, like the Samsung Internet app. Tap an input field in the app, like the search bar, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. 

Next, either press the hardware key that is set up as your camera trigger (if using a rugged device like the XCover Pro), or tap the Knox Capture button on the on-screen keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is set as the default.

Once the camera is triggered, point it at the barcode you want to scan. After the camera focuses, Knox Capture will automatically capture the barcode data, process it, and send it to the app as keyboard input.

So in summary:
1. Open target app and tap input field 
2. Trigger camera scanner by pressing hardware button or tapping Knox Capture button
3. Aim camera at barcode to scan it
4. Processed barcode data is sent to app as keystrokes",1,3,5,0.3333333333333333,0.9998652935028076,0,14.134941339492798,"Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details.

Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Describe how an IT admin could configure Knox Capture profiles for an Android app that contains multiple activities such as user data forms and search input fields.,"IT admins can associate individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles in an Android app. This allows for more fine-grained control over scanning contexts within an app. A single profile can have several apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile"," Based on the context, an IT admin could configure Knox Capture profiles for an Android app with multiple activities in the following way:

The IT admin can create separate profiles for different activities within the same app. For example, they can create one profile associated with the user data form activity that appends a Tab key event to scanned data. They can create another profile associated with the search input field activity that appends an Enter key event to scanned data. 

To associate activities with profiles, the admin can use the visual selection tool in Knox Capture to navigate within the app and select individual activities. They can also search for specific activity names and select them from the list. 

A single profile can have multiple apps or activities associated with it. But each activity can only belong to one profile.",1,1,5,1.0,0.999687671661377,1,16.717348098754883,"Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",373

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09.

This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria. These rules convert scanned data into various formats, which are then passed to business apps through keystrokes. To create a rule and configure its actions and criteria: 1

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",245
- What components make up a Scanning Profile in Knox Capture?,"A Scanning Profile in Knox Capture is a configuration file that is created by the IT admin. It contains elements such as apps, activities, scanner engine settings and camera behavior"," Based on the context provided, a Scanning Profile in Knox Capture consists of the following components:

- Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner

- Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom)

- Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.)",1,1,5,1.0,0.9971590042114258,1,14.556152582168579,"Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",601
- What barcode technologies are supported in the default scanning profile of Knox Capture?,"The default scanning profile of Knox Capture supports multiple barcode technologies including QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc"," Based on the given context, the barcode technologies supported in the default scanning profile of Knox Capture are:

- QR
- Code 128 
- Code 39
- EAN8
- EAN13/UPCA
- UPCE  
- Interleaved 2 of 5
- Data Matrix

But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.9 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.9 introduces the following new features: #Support for AR demo mode You can now test the Knox Capture AR feature without having to set up a real server or go through any profile creation or setup process. To learn more about this new feature, please see the Demo AR guide. #On-screen suggestions for increasing scanning success rate To help increase the success rate of barcode scans, Knox Capture now provides suggestions on-screen to tell end-users when their device is either too far from a barcode, or at an angle in which the barcode cannot be easily read. #Ability to turn on flashlight by default You can now choose from three different flashlight options (Off/On/Automatic) in the scan engine settings, making it easier for device users to work in all lighting conditions. To learn about these flashlight options, see Configure scan engine settings. Knox Capture: Scandit Edition only supports On and Off as flashlight options. #Official support for inverted-color recognition on all barcode types In Knox Capture v1.8, we introduced inverse color recognition for DataMatrix and QR barcode types. In this release, your users can now scan inverted-color barcodes on all available barcode types. To learn how to use this feature, see Configure scan engine settings. #Support for QR code license scanning To help speed up the license activation workflow for end-users, you can now generate a Knox Suite license as a QR code, then have end-users scan that QR code to automatically enter the license key in their app. Knox Capture does not generate a QR code for you. #Knox Capture SDK v1.1.0 This release of Knox Capture v1.9 also introduces a new version of the Knox Capture SDK for customers who wish to develop their own custom scanning applications. SDK v1.1.0 introduces a new mini scanner API and adds support for inverse color barcode recognition on all available barcode types. To learn more the Knox Capture SDK, see our developer documentation. Enhancements This release introduces the following feature enhancements: #Updated UI for Aim and scan feature When using the Aim and scan feature, users will now see a distinct blue line when a barcode is detected, and a white line when the barcode is not detected. Previously, users would see a white line before and after barcode detection. #Improved support menu In the app's support menu, you can now tap a button to quickly contact a Knox sales representative.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",309
- What method can be used to deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across multiple devices?,Knox Capture can be deployed with a custom scanning configuration across multiple devices using an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) console. The EMM provider used will depend on an organization's specific needs and resources," Based on the context, Knox Capture can be deployed with a custom scanning configuration across multiple devices using an EMM/UEM. The steps are:

1. An IT admin installs Knox Capture on a device, configures scanning profiles, and exports the configuration as a text file. 

2. The admin adds Knox Capture to their Managed Google Play Store.

3. They assign the app to a group/organization in their EMM/UEM console and launch the app configuration dialog. 

4. The admin copies and pastes the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field in the EMM/UEM console.

5. Finally, the admin saves the updated settings in their EMM/UEM and deploys Knox Capture.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999277591705322,1,11.884007692337036,". Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key

How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.",178
"According to the context, what are the three different methods that Knox Capture offers for an app to receive an Android intent?","Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent: using an activity, using a foreground service, and using a broadcast receiver"," The three different methods Knox Capture offers for an app to receive an Android intent are:

1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through.

2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 

3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted.",1,2,5,0.5,0.9999270439147949,1,12.226014375686646,". Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1. On the Knox Capture home screen, tap on the profile you want to set intent output for. 2. Under Intent output, tap Select app packages. 3. Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",608

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Use test mode. Check the scanning configuration by starting Knox Capture's system-wide test mode and launching a business app. Use test mode to visually confirm scan engine settings and keystroke output rules for each app in the configuration. Start test mode 1. Start test mode and open the Test configuration screen in one of the following ways: Tap the More actions menu icon next to the Profiles label on the home screen. Select Test apps. Tap the Share button in the lower-right of the home screen. Then, tap the Test configuration button in the Share configuration menu. 2. After starting test mode, look for a system pop-up notification indicating Test mode is on. Select an app to test 1. Either search for an app and tap the Open button next to it in the list on the Test apps screen, or exit Knox Capture and open the app. 2. Review the content of the blue test overlay in the open app's UI. The overlay displays: Activity - The name of the activity in focus. Active profile - The Knox Capture profile to which the in-focus activity belongs. This is the profile defining scan settings and keystroke output rules for the in-focus activity. Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay",594
- What new capability does Knox Capture AR provide when a user scans a barcode?,"Knox Capture AR allows user to view important information on their device screen when performing a barcode scan, allowing them to interact with data in real-time and enhance overall efficiency", Knox Capture AR provides the capability to view and interact with barcode data in real-time via a customizable overlay displayed in the camera preview window. This allows users to analyze and take actions on barcode data without having to first send it to a business app.,1,1,5,1.0,0.9993407130241394,1,14.871703386306763,"AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",1312

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",315

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes",89

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",129
What are the new methods introduced in Knox Capture v1.3 to deactivate a license?,"Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license: by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard"," Based on the context provided, Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license:

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",567

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type.

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan.

Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",622

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device.

New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

How does an IT admin deliver barcode scanning capabilities to enterprise devices after configuring the app profile?,"Through the enterprise mobility management (EMM) solution, the IT admin can push the configured app profile to the enterprise devices. This enables the device users to start scanning barcodes with their business app"," Based on the context, an IT admin delivers barcode scanning capabilities to enterprise devices after configuring the app profile by:

Exporting the scanning profile configuration file from Knox Capture and importing it into their EMM/UEM (Enterprise Mobility Management/Unified Endpoint Management) solution. Once the configuration file is imported, the EMM/UEM can then deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to enterprise devices. When deployed as a managed app, Knox Capture enters Managed Mode on the devices, which allows end users to utilize the barcode scanning capabilities as permitted by the profile created by the IT admin, but restricts them from modifying the profile or app settings themselves.",1,1,5,1.0,0.9966013431549072,0,14.691449880599976,"Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.",707

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat",608
