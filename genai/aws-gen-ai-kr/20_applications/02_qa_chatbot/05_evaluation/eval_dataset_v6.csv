How does Knox Capture translate barcode data into keystrokes?,"Knox Capture translates barcode data into keystrokes by passing them back to the business applications for processing, which then allow them to appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device's keyboard",7ed2d1f4-6876-45d5-a18f-c66674a92d12,". When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode"

How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard.
