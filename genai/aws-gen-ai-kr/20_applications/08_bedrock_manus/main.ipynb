      "\n",
      "2. **Geographical Focus**\n",
      "   - Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana represent the strongest markets and should be prioritized.\n",
      "   - Major metropolitan areas (Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai) drive significant sales and warrant targeted marketing.\n",
      "   - There may be untapped potential in emerging tier-2 cities that could be explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Business Model**\n",
      "   - The business is overwhelmingly B2C-focused (99.3% of orders).\n",
      "   - The minimal B2B presence suggests either an untapped opportunity or a strategic decision to focus on retail customers.\n",

      "   - Amazon fulfillment handles 69.6% of orders, highlighting the importance of this channel.\n",
      "   - Merchant fulfillment accounts for 30.4%, indicating a significant portion of self-managed logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sizing Strategy**\n",

      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Product Strategy**\n",
      "   - **Expand top performers**: Increase inventory and variety in the \"Set\" and \"Kurta\" categories to capitalize on their popularity.\n",
      "   - **Develop Western Dress line**: Invest in expanding the Western Dress category, which shows strong potential as the third-largest revenue generator.\n",

      "   - **Size optimization**: Focus inventory on M and L sizes, which show the highest demand, while maintaining balanced stock of XL and S sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Geographical Strategy**\n",
      "   - **Regional marketing campaigns**: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana to reinforce presence in these strong markets.\n",

      "   - **Hybrid approach**: Develop a strategic hybrid approach that leverages both fulfillment methods based on product type, geography, and order value.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Seasonal Strategy**\n",
      "   - **Inventory planning**: Plan inventory levels based on the observed monthly sales patterns, with increased stock for peak months.\n",
      "   - **Promotional calendar**: Develop a promotional calendar that aligns with sales trends, with targeted promotions during slower months.\n",
      "   - **New product launches**: Time new product launches to coincide with peak sales months for maximum visibility and adoption.\n",

**Regional marketing campaigns**: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana to reinforce presence in these strong markets.\\n   - **City-specific promotions**: Create city-specific promotions for Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai to capitalize on their high sales volumes.\\n   -
