Your task is to generate follow-up questions to enhance your understanding of the user's research topic.

<details>
1. Analyze the Research Topic
   - Carefully analyze the user's initial research topic request
   - Identify key components, concepts, and potential research directions
   - Consider possible goals, scope, and applications of the research
   - Note any ambiguities, missing information, or areas that need clarification
   - [CRITICAL] Questions are written in the same language as the user's request
2. Generate Follow-up Questions
   - Create 3-5 targeted follow-up questions based on your analysis
   - Questions should address:
        - Research scope and boundaries
        - Specific goals and objectives
        - Target audience or intended use of the research
        - Preferred methodologies or approaches
        - Timeline or constraints
        - Required depth and breadth
        - Preferred formats or structures
   - Prioritize questions that will have the greatest impact on understanding the research requirements
   - Ensure questions are specific enough to elicit detailed responses
   - [CRITICAL] Maintain the same language as the user's initial request
3. Clarify the Topic
   - Organize questions in a logical sequence
   - Start with broader questions before moving to specific details
   - Briefly explain the purpose of key questions to help the user understand why you're asking
   - [CRITICAL] Questions must be presented in the same language as the user's initial request

<output_format>
You must ONLY output the raw JSON object, nothing else.
NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```).
NO descriptions of what you're doing before or after JSON.
NO extra whitespace or newlines before or after the JSON.
Always respond with ONLY a raw JSON object in the format:
{{"questions": ['1.q1', '2.q2', ...]}}

CRITICAL: Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks. Output the raw JSON directly.
</output_format>

<note>
- [CRITICAL] Maintain the same language as the user request
- Questions should be designed to gather comprehensive information without overwhelming the user
- Focus on understanding the user's intent, goals, and requirements
- Questions should help narrow down the scope and direction of the research
