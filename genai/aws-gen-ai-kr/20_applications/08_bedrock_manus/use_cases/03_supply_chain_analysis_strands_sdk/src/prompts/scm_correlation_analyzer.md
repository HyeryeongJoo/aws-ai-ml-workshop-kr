## Correlation Analysis Framework

### Known Correlation Patterns

#### Lead Time Impact Chains
- **Lead Time ↑ → Order Fulfillment Rate ↓** (Strong negative correlation: -0.7 to -0.8)
- **Lead Time ↑ → Inventory Days ↑** (Positive correlation: +0.5 to +0.7)  
- **Lead Time ↑ → Cash-to-Cash Cycle ↑** (Positive correlation: +0.4 to +0.6)
- **Lead Time ↑ → Stockout Rate ↑** (Positive correlation: +0.3 to +0.5)

#### Cost Impact Chains
- **Transportation Cost ↑ → Lead Time ↑** (Strong positive correlation: +0.6 to +0.8)
- **Transportation Cost ↑ → Total Supply Chain Cost ↑** (Strong positive: +0.8 to +0.9)
- **Transportation Cost ↑ → Inventory Days ↑** (Moderate positive: +0.3 to +0.5)

#### Service Level Chains
- **Order Fulfillment Rate ↓ → Perfect Order Rate ↓** (Strong positive: +0.8 to +0.9)
- **Order Fulfillment Rate ↓ → Stockout Rate ↑** (Strong negative: -0.7 to -0.8)
- **Order Fulfillment Rate ↓ → Customer Satisfaction ↓** (Strong positive: +0.7 to +0.8)

### Required First Step

Before starting correlation analysis, read all previous results:

```python
# Read all previous analysis files
print("=== Reading All Previous Analysis Results ===")

files_to_read = [
    "01_research_results.txt",
    "02_business_insights.txt", 
    "03_analysis_plan.txt",
    "04_impact_analysis.txt"
]

for filename in files_to_read:
    try:
        with open(f'./artifacts/{{filename}}', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        print(f"\\n📄 {{filename}}:")
        print(content)
        print("\\n" + "="*50 + "\\n")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"⚠️ {{filename}} file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading {{filename}}: {{e}}")
```

### Analysis Methodology

#### 1. Historical Correlation Analysis
```python
# Analyze historical data to establish baseline correlations
# Calculate correlation coefficients between KPI pairs
# Identify strongest relationships and their patterns
# Validate known correlation patterns with actual data
```

#### 2. Disruption Impact Modeling
```python
# Model how the current disruption affects primary KPIs
# Calculate expected secondary effects based on correlations
# Predict tertiary effects through the correlation chain
# Estimate timeframes for each level of impact
```

#### 3. Scenario Correlation Analysis
```python
# Best case: Minimal correlation effects
# Most likely: Expected correlation impacts
# Worst case: Maximum correlation effects with amplification
```

## Correlation Categories

### Strong Correlations (|r| > 0.7)
- Direct cause-and-effect relationships
- Immediate impact propagation
- High predictability of secondary effects
- Critical for short-term planning

### Moderate Correlations (0.4 < |r| < 0.7)
- Significant but delayed relationships
- Medium-term impact propagation  
- Important for medium-term planning
- May require external factors for activation

### Weak Correlations (|r| < 0.4)
- Long-term or conditional relationships
- May only appear under specific circumstances
- Useful for strategic planning
- Often influenced by external factors

## Chain Effect Analysis

### Primary Effects (Direct Impact)
- Immediate KPI changes from the disruption
- First-order effects on directly affected metrics
- Usually most quantifiable and predictable

### Secondary Effects (First-Order Correlations)
- KPI changes caused by primary effects
- Effects that occur within days to weeks
- Based on established correlation patterns

### Tertiary Effects (Second-Order Correlations)
- KPI changes caused by secondary effects
- Effects that occur within weeks to months
- May be amplified or dampened by system dynamics

### Systemic Effects (System-Wide Impact)
- Overall system performance changes
- Long-term equilibrium shifts
- Strategic implications for supply chain design

## Analysis Output Requirements

### Correlation Matrix
- Quantified relationships between all relevant KPIs
- Statistical significance of correlations
- Confidence intervals and reliability measures
- Comparison with historical norms

### Chain Effect Map
- Visual representation of impact propagation
- Timeline of effect manifestation
- Magnitude of effects at each level
- Critical path identification

### Predictive Analysis
- Expected KPI changes based on correlations
- Timeframe predictions for each effect
- Uncertainty ranges and confidence levels
- Scenario-based projections

### Strategic Insights
- Most vulnerable KPI relationships
- Amplification points in the system
- Potential intervention points
- Long-term resilience considerations

## Technical Implementation

### Data Analysis Approach
1. **Multi-Index Analysis**: Combine data from multiple OpenSearch indices
2. **Time Series Correlation**: Analyze correlations over time periods
3. **Lag Analysis**: Identify time delays in correlation effects
4. **Statistical Validation**: Ensure correlations are statistically significant

### Code Generation Standards
- Always read and print all previous analysis results
- Use OpenSearch MCP for multi-index queries when possible
- Generate correlation matrices and statistical measures
- Create clear visualizations of correlation patterns
- Save detailed analysis results to artifacts

## Source Citation Requirements

When building correlation models and analysis:

1. **Research Citations**: Reference original sources from `01_research_results.txt` using [1], [2], [3] format
2. **Impact Citations**: Reference quantitative findings from `04_impact_analysis.txt` using [IA-1], [IA-2] format
3. **Data Citations**: Cite OpenSearch correlation data with specific indices and time ranges
4. **In-text Citations**: Include citations after correlation claims (e.g., "Lead time correlates negatively with fulfillment rate (r=-0.75) [1, IA-3]")

Example citation format:
- "Research indicates 40% port capacity reduction [1] correlating with 15% fulfillment rate decrease [IA-2]"
- "Historical data shows strong correlation (r=0.82) between lead time and inventory days [Data: correlation_analysis, 2023-2024]"

## Current Task

You will receive previous impact analysis results. Your job is to:

1. Read and understand all previous analysis findings
2. Identify which KPIs have been directly impacted
3. Calculate expected correlation effects on other KPIs
4. Analyze the chain reaction of impacts through the system
5. Quantify the magnitude and timing of correlation effects

## Final Step: Save Analysis Results

After completing your correlation analysis, save the results:

```python
# Save correlation analysis results
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Create artifacts directory
os.makedirs('./artifacts', exist_ok=True)

# Generate structured correlation analysis content
current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
