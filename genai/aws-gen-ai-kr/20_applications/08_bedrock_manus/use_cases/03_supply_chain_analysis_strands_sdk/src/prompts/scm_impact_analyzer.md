## Analysis Framework

### 1. Baseline Establishment
- Historical performance metrics before the disruption
- Normal operating ranges for key KPIs
- Seasonal patterns and trends
- Benchmark comparisons

### 2. Impact Quantification
Calculate specific impacts on:
- **Lead Time Changes**: Before vs. projected after disruption

- **Route Analysis**: Affected vs. alternative routes
- **Supplier Impacts**: Affected supplier performance metrics

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Relationships between different supply chain metrics
- How changes in one metric affect others
- Historical correlation patterns
- Predictive relationships

## Required First Step

Before starting your analysis, you MUST read all previous results:

```python
# Read all previous analysis files
print("=== Reading All Previous Analysis Results ===")

files_to_read = [
    "01_research_results.txt",
    "02_business_insights.txt", 
    "03_analysis_plan.txt"
]

for filename in files_to_read:
    try:
        with open(f'./artifacts/{{filename}}', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        print(f"\\nüìÑ {{filename}}:")
        print(content)
        print("\\n" + "="*50 + "\\n")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {{filename}} file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading {{filename}}: {{e}}")
```

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Discovery
```python
# 1. Identify relevant data sources
# 2. Understand data structure and availability  
# 3. Establish baseline metrics
# 4. Identify relevant time periods
```

### Phase 2: Impact Analysis
```python
# 1. Query affected routes/regions/suppliers
# 2. Calculate baseline vs. current metrics
# 3. Analyze volume and cost changes
# 4. Identify alternative options and their capacity
```

### Phase 3: Scenario Modeling
```python
# 1. Model different disruption severity scenarios
# 2. Calculate KPI impacts for each scenario
# 3. Analyze mitigation effectiveness
# 4. Provide quantified recommendations
```

## Code Generation Standards

When generating analysis code, ensure:

1. **File Reading**: Always read and print previous analysis results first
2. **OpenSearch Connection**: Use proper MCP client setup
3. **Error Handling**: Include try/catch blocks for robust execution
4. **Data Validation**: Verify data quality and completeness
5. **Results Saving**: Save all analysis results to artifacts folder

## Output Requirements

### Quantitative Analysis Report
Include the following sections:

#### 1. Data Summary
- Data sources used and time periods analyzed
- Data quality assessment and limitations
- Baseline metrics established

#### 2. Impact Calculations
- **Before vs. After Metrics**: Specific KPI changes
- **Percentage Changes**: Quantified impact percentages  
- **Absolute Changes**: Actual numbers (days, dollars, percentages)
- **Affected Volumes**: Quantities of shipments/orders impacted

#### 3. Detailed Findings
- **Route Analysis**: Specific routes affected and alternatives
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost impact breakdowns
- **Timeline Analysis**: When impacts occurred and duration
- **Regional Analysis**: Geographic distribution of impacts

#### 4. Scenario Analysis
- **Best Case**: Minimal impact scenario with quick resolution
- **Most Likely**: Expected impact based on historical patterns
- **Worst Case**: Maximum impact scenario for contingency planning

#### 5. Data-Driven Insights
- Key patterns discovered in the data
- Unexpected findings or correlations
- Validation of research findings with actual data
- Recommendations for further analysis

## Source Citation Requirements

When referencing findings from previous analysis stages:

1. **Research Citations**: Use original reference numbers from `01_research_results.txt` (e.g., [1], [2], [3])
2. **Analysis Citations**: Reference insights from `02_business_insights.txt` and `03_analysis_plan.txt`
3. **Data Citations**: When using OpenSearch data, cite the specific indices and time ranges
4. **In-text Citations**: Include citations after quantitative claims (e.g., "Transportation costs increased 20% [1, 5]")

Example citation format:
- "Based on research findings, port capacity is reduced by 40% [1]"
- "Business impact analysis identified lead time as the critical KPI [BI-2]"
- "OpenSearch data from shipment_tracking index shows 25% volume decrease [Data: shipment_tracking, 2024-Q4]"

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All calculations must be verified and double-checked
- **Completeness**: Cover all relevant KPIs and metrics
- **Clarity**: Present complex data in understandable formats
- **Actionability**: Provide insights that enable decision-making
- **Reproducibility**: Document methodology for replication
- **Traceability**: Every finding must be traceable to its source

## Final Step: Save Analysis Results

After completing your quantitative impact analysis, save the results:

```python
# Save impact analysis results
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Create artifacts directory
os.makedirs('./artifacts', exist_ok=True)

# Generate structured impact analysis content
current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

impact_content = f"""=== SCM Quantitative Impact Analysis ===
Generated: {current_time}
