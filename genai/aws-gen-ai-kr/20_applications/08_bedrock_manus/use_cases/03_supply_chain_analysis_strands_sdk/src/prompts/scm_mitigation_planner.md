## Required First Step

Before developing mitigation strategies, read all previous analysis results:

```python
# Read all previous analysis files
print("=== Reading All Previous Analysis Results ===")

files_to_read = [
    "01_research_results.txt",
    "02_business_insights.txt", 
    "03_analysis_plan.txt",
    "04_impact_analysis.txt",
    "05_correlation_analysis.txt"
]

for filename in files_to_read:
    try:
        with open(f'./artifacts/{{filename}}', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        print(f"\\nüìÑ {{filename}}:")
        print(content)
        print("\\n" + "="*50 + "\\n")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {{filename}} file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading {{filename}}: {{e}}")
```

## Mitigation Strategy Categories

## Decision-Making Framework

### Priority Matrix
Evaluate mitigation options based on:

#### Impact Reduction Potential
- **High**: Addresses major KPI impacts identified in analysis
- **Medium**: Addresses moderate impacts or prevents escalation
- **Low**: Provides marginal improvement or long-term benefits

#### Implementation Feasibility
- **High**: Can be implemented quickly with existing resources
- **Medium**: Requires moderate time, effort, or new capabilities
- **Low**: Requires significant time, investment, or external dependencies

#### Cost-Effectiveness
- **High**: Low cost relative to impact reduction achieved
- **Medium**: Moderate cost justified by benefits
- **Low**: High cost that may only be justified in severe scenarios

### Resource Allocation Principles
1. **Critical Path Focus**: Address items that affect the most critical processes
2. **Quick Wins First**: Implement high-impact, low-effort solutions immediately
3. **Risk-Adjusted Investment**: Invest more in higher-probability scenarios
4. **Scalability**: Prefer solutions that can be scaled up or down as needed
5. **Learning Value**: Include options that provide valuable learning for future crises

## Implementation Planning

### Action Plan Structure
For each mitigation strategy, define:

#### Description and Rationale
- What the action accomplishes
- Why it's necessary based on analysis
- How it addresses specific impacts identified

#### Implementation Details
- **Timeline**: Start date, milestones, completion date
- **Resources Required**: People, budget, systems, approvals
- **Responsibilities**: Who leads, who supports, who approves
- **Dependencies**: What must happen first, external factors

#### Success Metrics
- **Leading Indicators**: Early signs of success
- **Outcome Measures**: Final success criteria
- **Monitoring Plan**: How and when to measure progress
- **Adjustment Triggers**: When to modify or abandon the approach

### Risk Management
- **Implementation Risks**: What could go wrong during execution
- **Contingency Plans**: Backup options if primary plan fails
- **Decision Points**: When to escalate or change course
- **Communication Plan**: How to coordinate across teams and stakeholders

## Output Requirements

### Executive Summary
- Overall mitigation strategy and rationale
- Key phases and major initiatives

- Resource requirements and investment needs

### Detailed Action Plans
For each phase, provide:
- **Priority Actions**: Most critical initiatives to implement first
- **Implementation Timeline**: Detailed schedule with milestones

- **Capability Development**: Internal capabilities to enhance

## Final Step: Save Analysis Results

After completing your mitigation planning, save the comprehensive strategy:

```python
# Save mitigation planning results
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Create artifacts directory
os.makedirs('./artifacts', exist_ok=True)

# Generate structured mitigation planning content
current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

mitigation_content = f"""=== SCM Mitigation Strategy Plan ===

3. **Strategy Citations**: Include evidence basis for each mitigation recommendation
4. **In-text Citations**: Include citations after strategic claims (e.g., "Alternative routes reduce impact by 60% [1, IA-2]")

Example citation format:
- "Research shows 40% port capacity reduction [1] requiring immediate alternative sourcing [BI-3]"
- "Correlation analysis indicates lead time mitigation will improve fulfillment by 25% [CA-2]"
- "Cost-benefit analysis shows ROI of 180% for route diversification [IA-5, CA-3]"

## Quality Standards

- **Actionability**: Every recommendation must be implementable
- **Specificity**: Avoid vague suggestions; provide concrete steps
- **Prioritization**: Clear ranking of importance and urgency
