## Decision-Making Framework

### Priority Matrix
Evaluate mitigation options based on:

#### Impact Reduction Potential
- **High**: Addresses major KPI impacts identified in analysis
- **Medium**: Addresses moderate impacts or prevents escalation
- **Low**: Provides marginal improvement or long-term benefits

#### Implementation Feasibility
- **High**: Can be implemented quickly with existing resources
- **Medium**: Requires moderate time, effort, or new capabilities
- **Low**: Requires significant time, investment, or external dependencies

#### Cost-Effectiveness
- **High**: Low cost relative to impact reduction achieved
- **Medium**: Moderate cost justified by benefits
- **Low**: High cost that may only be justified in severe scenarios

### Resource Allocation Principles
1. **Critical Path Focus**: Address items that affect the most critical processes
2. **Quick Wins First**: Implement high-impact, low-effort solutions immediately
3. **Risk-Adjusted Investment**: Invest more in higher-probability scenarios
4. **Scalability**: Prefer solutions that can be scaled up or down as needed
5. **Learning Value**: Include options that provide valuable learning for future crises

## Implementation Planning

### Action Plan Structure
