## Problem Statement
Establish foundational understanding of Chicago port, including its historical development, current infrastructure, operations, and key characteristics.

## Research Findings

### Topic 1: Historical Development and Evolution
- The modern Port of Chicago's history began in 1921 with the Lake Calumet Harbor Act authorizing the city to build a deep-water port at Lake Calumet [1]
- The Van Vlissingen Plan, adopted in 1921, remains the port's basic framework for commercial shipping and industrial development [1]
- The Illinois International Port District (IIPD) was created in 1951 to manage the port facilities [2]

### Topic 2: Current Infrastructure and Facilities
- The port consists of two main facilities [1][3]:
  1. Iroquois Landing Terminal:
     - Located at the mouth of the Calumet River
     - 100-acre open paved terminal
     - 3,000 linear feet of ship and barge berthing space
     - Two 110,000 square-foot transit sheds
     - Direct truck and rail access
  2. Senator Dan Dougherty Harbor (Lake Calumet Terminal):
     - Located 6 miles inland from Lake Michigan
     - At the junction of Grand Calumet and Little Calumet Rivers
     - Three transit sheds totaling over 400,000 square feet
     - Multiple warehouse facilities
- Total land area encompasses approximately 1,600 acres [1]
- Facilities are served by rail connections and adjacent to three interstate highways [1]

### Topic 3: Port Operations and Capacity
- Ranked 38th nationally and 2nd in the Great Lakes for cargo volume [4]
- Handled 16.7 million tons of freight (recent data) [4]
- Moves more general cargo than any other port on the Great Lakes [5]
- Annual waterborne tonnage exceeds 19 million tons [5]
- Features grain elevators with combined capacity of 14 million bushels [6]
- Liquid bulk storage capacity of 800,000 barrels [6]

### Topic 4: Geographic Location and Advantages
- Strategic location on Lake Michigan with access to:
  - Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway system [3]
  - Mississippi River system via the Illinois Waterway [4]
  - Atlantic Ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway [3]
- Multimodal connections including [4]:
  - Rail facilities
  - Three interstate highways
  - Inland waterway system
- Part of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) [4]
- Serves as a crucial link between inland canal and river systems in the Midwest and global shipping markets [3]

### Topic 5: Cargo Types and Operations
- Handles diverse cargo types including:
  - General cargo
  - Bulk materials
  - Grain
  - Liquid bulk
- Functions as a landlord port, leasing sites and facilities to private companies [3]

- High reliability: Official port statistics and documentation

## Conclusion
The Port of Chicago represents a significant maritime infrastructure asset with a century-long history. Its strategic location, extensive facilities, and multimodal connections make it a crucial hub for regional and international trade. The port's dual facilities at Iroquois Landing and Lake Calumet provide diverse capabilities for handling various cargo types, while its connection to both the Great Lakes and inland waterway systems positions it as a vital link in the national transportation network. Recent statistics showing its ranking among U.S. ports and substantial cargo volumes demonstrate its continued importance to regional and national commerce.
