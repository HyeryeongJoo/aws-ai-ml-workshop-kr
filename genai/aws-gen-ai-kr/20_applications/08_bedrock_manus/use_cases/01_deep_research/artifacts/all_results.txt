Result Description: 

Feature analysis for Amazon Bedrock Foundation Models:

1. Context Window Length:
   - Claude family models: Consistent 200K tokens
   - Nova family models: Variable context lengths based on model type

2. Multimodal Capabilities:
   - Nova Lite and Pro: Full multimodal support
   - Nova Micro: Text-only
   - Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 3.5 Sonnet: Multimodal with computer use
   - Claude 3.5 Haiku and 3 Haiku: Text-only

3. Advanced Features:
   - Computer Use (Beta): Available in Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 3.5 Sonnet
   - Batch Processing: Supported by most models except Nova Pro (Latency Opt) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet

4. Regional Availability (Seoul):
   - Currently Available: Nova family, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku
   - Coming Soon: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Q3 2025), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Q2 2025)

Key Observations:
1. Nova family offers more consistent feature availability across models
2. Claude models excel in advanced capabilities but have varying regional availability
3. Batch processing support is widespread, enabling cost optimization
4. Seoul region availability is expanding with new models planned for 2025
