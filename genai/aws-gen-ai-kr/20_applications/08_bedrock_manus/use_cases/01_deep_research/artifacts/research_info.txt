  * Offers up to 50% discount compared to on-demand pricing
  * Available for select foundation models from:
    - Anthropic
    - Meta
    - Mistral AI
    - Amazon
  * Ideal for large-scale, non-time-sensitive predictions
  * Results stored in S3 bucket for later access

### Topic 8: Additional Cost Optimization Features
- Prompt Caching [5]:
  * Up to 90% discount on cached tokens
  * Up to 85% latency improvement
  * Cache duration: 5 minutes
  * Isolated per AWS account
  * Available for repeated context/prefixes

- Intelligent Prompt Routing [5]:
  * Automatically selects most cost-effective model
  * Can reduce costs by up to 30%
  * Routes based on prompt complexity
  * Available within same model family
  * No additional charge for the routing service

## Original full text
[5]: [Amazon Bedrock offers two pricing plans for inference: 1. On-Demand and Batch mode with pay-as-you-go pricing and no commitments, and 2. Provisioned Throughput mode for consistent workloads with 1-month or 6-month commitments. Batch mode offers up to 50% lower costs compared to on-demand pricing for select foundation models.]

[6]: [Provisioned Throughput mode allows you to reserve model units for specific base or custom models, designed for large consistent inference workloads needing guaranteed throughput. Custom models can only be accessed using Provisioned Throughput. Pricing is charged hourly with 1-month or 6-month commitment terms available.]

## Conclusion
The research has identified comprehensive pricing information for both Nova and Claude series models, including on-demand, batch, and provisioned throughput options. Cost optimization features like prompt caching and intelligent routing are available to help reduce costs. The RI policy is implemented through Provisioned Throughput with 1-month or 6-month commitments, offering guaranteed performance for consistent workloads.
