## Original full text
[13]: "Amazon Bedrock helps ensure that your data stays under your control. When you tune a foundation model, we base it on a private copy of that model. This means your data is not shared with model providers, and is not used to improve the base models."

[14]: "Amazon Bedrock offers comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities that can support your governance and audit requirements. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track usage metrics and build customized dashboards with metrics that can be used for your audit purposes."

[15]: "For healthcare organizations, financial institutions, and enterprises handling confidential information, these risks can result in regulatory compliance violations and breach of customer trust. This security architecture combines Amazon Bedrock guardrails with granular access controls."

[16]: "Azure AI Foundry is more cost-efficient for businesses that require a Microsoft-driven AI ecosystem, whereas Amazon Bedrock is better suited for AWS-native workloads. While Amazon Bedrock supports AI for data analytics, it lacks deep integration with enterprise-grade BI tools like Power BI."

[17]: "Since our preview launch in July, developers have fine-tuned Claude 3 Haiku for use cases ranging from complex legal research analysis to automated financial transaction processing to customer support automation."

[18]: "SK Telecom's collaboration with AWS GenAIIC showcases the company's commitment to developing innovative AI solutions. By using Amazon Bedrock to customize Anthropic's Claude models, SKT has achieved significant performance improvements for telco-specific, Korean language use cases without the need to build models from scratch."
