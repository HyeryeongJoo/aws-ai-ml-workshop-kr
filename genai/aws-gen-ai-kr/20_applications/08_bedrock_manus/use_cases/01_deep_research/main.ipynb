Here’s why.\\n\\nAmazon’s new Nova family of foundational models and new latency-optimized inference on Amazon Bedrock are home runs for Amazon Web Services partners.\\n“We’re really excited about the Nova models because there’s a massive opportunity there,” said Randall Hunt, chief technology officer at AWS Premier Tier Services Partner Caylent. “Think about the applications this can be used for in security cameras, for retail, for sports, for just any sort of generative search that you want to perform over video footage or if you want to generate product videos.”\\n“It was possible before, but it was not enabled seamlessly through an API and now it’s one API call,” said Hunt, whose company’s AWS business soared a whopping 80 percent in 2024. “So I’m not having to go and spin up a bunch of servers and deal with dynamic frame sampling and all these other complexities.”\\n[Related: AWS CEO re:Invent Keynote: 7 Bold Google, Windows, VMware And ‘Game-Changing’ Innovation Remarks]\\nLaunched at AWS re:Invent 2024 in Las Vegas this week, Amazon Nova foundational models (FMs) are a new generation of AI models aimed at delivering intelligence and industry leading price performance on Amazon Bedrock.\\nNova’s mission is to lower costs and latency for any generative AI task with customers able to build on Nova FMs to analyze documents and videos, understand charts and diagrams, generate video content, and build sophisticated AI agents.\\nNew ‘Killer Feature’: Latency-Optimized Inference For Bedrock\\nCaylent was one of the AWS launch partners for Nova and had early access to the foundational models while collaborating tightly with AWS on the development and price performance. “I’m very impressed with where they arrived at,” said Hunt (pictured above).\\nOne new feature that will help drive AI and GenAI adoption for Amazon Bedrock and new Nova models is AWS’ new latency-optimized inference for FMs in Amazon Bedrock. This new latency-optimized inference unveiled at AWS re:Invent this week aims to deliver faster response times and improved responsiveness for AI applications.\\nCurrently, Bedrock’s new inference options support Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku model and Meta's Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models to provide reduced latency compared to standard models without compromising accuracy.\\n“The number of people can take advantage of it in a shared tenancy way, which is what the new Bedrock latency optimized inference allows—that is just going to be a killer feature,” said Hunt. “The price point, it comes at a 25 percent price premium to the other Bedrock options. So you get Anthropic 3.5 Haiku and Llama 3.1405b at a 25 percent price premium, but hundreds of tokens per second faster.”\\nIrvine, Calif.-based Caylent is one of AWS’ most innovative partners in the world. This year, the company won AWS Migration Partner of the Year award, AWS’ GenAI Industry Solution Partner of the Year award, and Industry Partner of the Year award for Financial Services for North America.\\nThis week, Caylent launched its own Applied Intelligence delivery model dedicated to AI-first cloud services. It is designed to lower the barriers of cloud migration and modernization through the strategic and intentional application of AI at every stage of a customer’s cloud evolution.\\nCaylent’s CTO said at the end of the day “everyone is just trying to get the highest quality tokens, lowest possible cost” as quickly as possible. “Amazon is enabling them with this new investment in Trainium and Bedrock latency optimized inference,” Hunt said. “We’re super excited about those.”\\nAWS said both Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku and Llama models run faster on AWS compared to any other major cloud provider.\\nAmazon’s Three Nova Models: Micro, Lite And Pro\\nThe Amazon Nova models include three understanding models designed to meet customers’ different needs: Micro, Lite And Pro.\\nAmazon Nova Micro is a text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses in the Amazon Nova family of models. With a context length of 128K tokens and optimized for speed and cost, Nova Micro excels at tasks such as text summarization, translation, content classification, interactive chat and brainstorming, and simple mathematical reasoning and coding.\\nNext up is Amazon Nova Lite, a very low-cost multimodal model targeting processing image, video, and text inputs to generate text output. Nova Lite can handle real-time customer interactions, document analysis, and visual question-answering tasks with high accuracy. The model processes inputs up to 300,000 tokens in length and can analyze multiple images or up to 30 minutes of video in a single request.\\nLastly, Amazon Nova Pro is a multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost for a wide range of tasks I the Nova family. Nova Pro is capable of processing up to 300,000 input tokens and process code bases with over 15,000 lines of code. AWS said Pro sets new standards in multimodal intelligence and agentic workflows that require calling APIs and tools to complete complex workflows.\\nDeloitte Consulting’s leading AWS executive, JB McGinnis, said Amazon Nova highlights AWS’ commitment to delivering flexibility and choice in AI.\\n“By offering a diverse suite of foundation models, AWS empowers organizations to select the tools best suited for their specific workloads and industries,” said McGinnis. “This approach realizes that no two businesses are the same, and ensures that companies can tailor AI solutions to their unique needs.”\\nHe said Nova shows the shift towards adaptable AI systems to give enterprises the ability to innovate with precision and confidence while maintaining control over costs and scalability. “It’s a critical step in enabling broader adoption across industries,” McGinnis said.\"}, {\"title\": \"Claude 3.5 Sonnet Bedrock Regions\", \"url\": \"https://claude3.pro/claude-3-5-sonnet-bedrock-regions/\", \"raw_content\": \"Published Time: 2024-08-24T12:25:21+00:00\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet Bedrock Regions\\n===============\\nSkip to content\\n\\nMenu\\n\\nHome\\nBlog\\nFAQs\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nDMCA Policy\\n\\n\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet Bedrock Regions\\nAugust 24, 2024 by Claude.ai\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet Bedrock Regions.In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Claude 3.5 Sonnet stands out as a beacon of innovation and capability.

Available through a paid subscription on the Claude AI website, Haiku excels in analyzing extensive scientific articles—handling around 10,000 tokens in under 3 seconds. For its class, Haiku sets an absolute record in processing speed, ensuring that users receive swift and efficient answers without delays.\\n\\nOpus  -  represents the pinnacle of Claude's capabilities, equipped to handle complex, multi-step tasks with ease. It can solve intricate mathematical equations, write sophisticated code, automate scientific research, analyze detailed graphs, and make accurate predictions. Available through a paid subscription on the Claude AI website, Opus processes large volumes of text seamlessly. Its superior \\\"intellect\\\" and readiness for tackling demanding tasks make Opus unparalleled in its class. While it may not be the fastest model, Opus stands out as the most powerful and versatile option, capable of managing a diverse range of applications with exceptional proficiency.\\n\\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet - following OpenAI's release of the GPT-4o model and its decision to make it entirely free for all users, many Claude AI and Gemini subscribers migrated to ChatGPT. Understandably, the $20 monthly subscription for Claude Opus and Gemini Pro lost some of its appeal, as GPT-4o outperformed these models across various tasks. However, on June 20, 2024, Anthropic aimed to reclaim its user base by launching Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which they claim surpasses GPT-4o in performance—and it's completely free for everyone!\\n\\nWhat's new in Claude 3.5 Sonnet? Key differences between Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku\\n\\nSo, what's new in Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic? As I mentioned earlier, it makes sense that Anthropic aims for Sonnet to directly compete with OpenAI's GPT-4, and of course, Anthropic hopes users will appreciate the new features of Claude AI. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has outperformed Anthropic's own Claude 3 Opus in many aspects, including speed, cost, and test results.\\n\\nIncreased performance and speed:\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic operates twice as fast as Claude 3 Opus, making it an ideal solution for many complex business tasks. For example, companies using Claude AI for customer support or managing multi-stage workflows will notice significant improvements.\\n\\nEnhanced capabilities\\n\\nLooking ahead, I must say that it seems to me Anthropic has released the most powerful language model available for free use. For example, Claude Opus has already shown better results in programming tasks compared to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro. And with the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the bar for efficiency has been raised even higher.\\n\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic demonstrates incredible success in understanding humor, jokes, and complex instructions. It excels at creating high-quality, naturally sounding content, and now you don't have to worry about the text sounding dry, lifeless, or too similar to typical AI-generated content, as often happens with ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn internal coding evaluations, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of tasks, significantly outperforming Claude 3 Opus, which managed only 38%. The model can independently write, edit, and execute code, easily translate code, and is ideal for updating legacy systems or efficiently migrating codebases. This makes it an invaluable tool for software engineering and machine learning tasks.\\n\\nAdditional visual capabilities\\n\\nAnother key improvement in Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the enhanced visual capabilities. Sonnet 3.5 has surpassed Claude 3 Opus in tasks that require analyzing and recognizing visual elements, whether it's charts or illustrations. Anthropic's Sonnet AI easily interprets graphs and diagrams, and accurately transcribes text from images, even if the image is damaged. Additionally, Claude 3.5 Sonnet excels in generating interactive charts and can even create presentations based on JSON data.\\n\\nGiven that Claude 3 free is available, it makes the model especially useful for industries like retail, logistics, and financial services, where AI can extract more valuable insights from images and charts than from text alone. This visual data extraction capability sets Claude AI apart from many other AI assistants, including some offerings like Google Cloud Vertex AI.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrompt\\n\\nPlease design a visually appealing slide for my presentation that includes a graph illustrating the monthly traffic changes.

While its capabilities are expansive, understanding its pricing structure is key to managing budgets and optimizing deployments. If you are new to GenAI or Bedrock we recommend starting with ourWhat is Amazon Bedrock? article.\\nWhen it comes to pricing there are two major categories of models: text & multimodal models (ChatGPT style models) and creative models which create images and videos.\\nSince Amazon Bedrock currently supports 60+ different models in Bedrock, we are going to focus on our top four picks in the text & multimodal models:\\n\\nAmazon Nova\\nAnthropic's Claude\\nMeta's Llama\\nDeepSeek\\n\\nAnd for creative models Amazon Nova—specifically Canvas & Reels—and Stability AI.\\nAmazon Bedrock Modes\\nYou can run Amazon Bedrock in different modes, each of which offers a different pricing scheme:\\n\\nOn-demand mode\\nBatch mode\\nProvisioned throughput\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nCustom Model Import\\nMarketplace models\\n\\nOn-Demand Mode\\nIn On-Demand mode, you’re only billed for the tokens you use in Amazon Bedrock—no time-based commitments. A token is a small unit of text—typically a few characters—that models use to interpret prompts and user input.\\n\\nFor text-generation models, you pay per input token processed and output token generated.\\nFor embeddings models, you're charged per input token processed.\\nFor image and video-generation models, you pay per image or video created (we will cover this in a different blog post).\\n\\nBatch Mode\\nAmazon Bedrock Batch mode lets you submit a file with multiple prompts and receive a single output file with the corresponding responses—ideal for large-scale, simultaneous predictions. The results are stored in your Amazon S3 bucket for easy access later. Amazon Bedrock supports batch inference with select foundation models from providers like Anthropic, Meta,and Amazon, offering up to 50% lower costs compared to On-Demand pricing. Some models (like DeepSeek) aren't offered in Batch Mode on Bedrock.\\nThe following table breaks down the costs*for the latest models from our top four provides (outlined above):\\n| Anthropic models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache read) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache write) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | N/A | N/A | $0.30 | $3.75 |\\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | $1.50 | $7.50 | $0.30 | $3.75 |\\n| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 | $0.50 | $2.50 | $1.00 | $0.08 |\\n| Amazon Nova models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache read) |\\n| Amazon Nova Micro | $0.04 | $0.14 | $0.02 | $0.07 | $0.01 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Lite | $0.06 | $0.24 | $0.03 | $0.12 | $0.02 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Pro | $0.80 | $3.20 | $0.40 | $1.60 | $0.20 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Pro (w/ latency optimized inference) | $1.00 | $4.00 | N/A | N/A | N/A | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Premier | $2.50 | $12.50 | $1.25 | $6.25 | N/A | - |\\n| Meta models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | NA | NA |\\n| Llama 4 Maverick 17B | $0.24 | $0.97 | $0.12 | $0.49 | - | - |\\n| Llama 4 Scout 17B | $0.17 | $0.66 | $0.09 | $0.33 | - | - |\\n| Llama 3.3 Instruct (70B) | $0.72 | $0.72 | $0.36 | $0.36 | - | - |\\n| DeepSeek Models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | NA | NA | NA | NA |\\n| DeepSeek-R1 | $1.35 | $5.40 | - | - | - | - |\\n\\nPricing is for AWS US regions. Pricing for other regions can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/\\n\\nFor more Amazon Bedrock pricing information, as well as token count limits checkout ourpublicly available Google Sheet, which tracks the following information:\\n\\nModel name\\nToken count\\nInputs (Text, Image, Video, audio)\\nOutputs (Text, Image, Video, audio)\\nSupported language #\\nCan be run in Bedrock (yes/no)\\nAllows fine tuning (yes/no)\\nWhether it is deprecated or not\\n\\n\\nProvisioned Throughput\\nProvisioned Throughput mode allows you to reserve model units for a specific base or custom model, making it ideal for large, consistent inference workloads that require guaranteed performance. This is the only mode that supports access to custom models. Each model unit delivers a set level of throughput, measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. Pricing is hourly, with the option to commit to either a 1-month or 6-month term.\\nMore information on purchasing Provisioned throughput can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-thru-purchase.html\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nLatency-optimized inference in Amazon Bedrock delivers faster response times, enhancing the performance of your generative AI applications. This option is available for Amazon Nova Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models. According to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Haiku runs faster on AWS than anywhere else. Similarly, Llama 3.1 models achieve the fastest performance on AWS compared to other major cloud providers.\\nYou can learn more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/latency-optimized-inference.html\\nCustom Model Import\\nCustom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock lets you bring in your previously customized models and run them just like Bedrock’s hosted foundation models—fully managed and available on demand. You can upload custom weights for supported model architectures and serve them using On-Demand mode, with no charge for the import itself. Once imported, the model is ready for use without any additional setup.\\nYou’re only billed for inference, based on the number of model copies needed to handle your traffic and how long each copy remains active, charged in 5-minute increments. A model copy is an instance of your imported model available to handle inference requests. Pricing per minute varies by model architecture, context length, AWS Region, compute unit version, and model copy size tier.\\nDetailed documentation on this approach can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-customization-import-model.html\\nMarketplace models\\nThe Amazon Bedrock Marketplace lets you discover, test, and use over 100 foundation models—including popular, emerging, and specialized options—directly within Bedrock. Models are deployed to dedicated endpoints, where you can choose instance types, set the number of instances, and configure auto-scaling to fit your workload needs.\\nFor proprietary models, pricing includes a software fee set by the model provider (billed per hour, per second, or per request) and an infrastructure fee based on your selected instance type. Pricing is clearly displayed before you subscribe and in the model’s AWS Marketplace listing. For publicly available models, you pay only the infrastructure fee tied to your instance selection.\\nA complete list of Marketplace Models can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-marketplace-model-reference.html\\nOther Pricing Factors\\nBeyond running vanilla versions of models, some models allow for fine tuning and other model distillations.\\nFine Tuning\\nCustomizing models incurs separate costs. Fine-tuning charges are based on data volume. For example,Amazon Nova Pro runs at $0.008 per 1,000 tokens. Fine-tuned models must use provisioned throughput for inference.\\nModel Distillation\\nAmazon Bedrock also allows customers to bring their own pre-trained models through the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature. These are billed by Custom Model Units (CMUs), at $0.0785 per minute per unit. A model using 2 CMUs for five minutes would cost roughly $0.79.\\nOther Tools & Optimization\\nA number of models also have additional tools that can be turned on and they have associated charges. This includes:\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nKnowledge bases\\nGuardrails\\nModel Evaluation\\nData Automation\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing\\nPrompt Optimization\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows is a no-code, visual workflow builder that enables you to design, test, and deploy generative AI applications by connecting foundation models, prompts, agents, and other AWS services into end-to-end solutions.\\nIn Bedrock Flows, you're billed based $0.035 per 1,000 node transitions—each time a node in your workflow executes, it counts as one transition. Charges are calculated from the total transitions across all your flows. Additional costs may apply if your workflow utilizes other AWS services or involves data transfers. For example, invoking an Amazon Bedrock Guardrail policy within your flow incurs charges based on the number of text units the policy processes.\\nLearn more about Amazon Bedrock Flows: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/flows/\\nKnowledge bases\\nTo enhance foundation models (FMs) with current and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)—a method that pulls relevant data from internal sources to improve the accuracy of responses. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a fully managed solution for implementing the entire RAG workflow, including ingestion, retrieval, prompt enrichment, session context management, and source attribution—without the need for custom data integrations. It also enables users to query or summarize a single document without setting up a vector database. For structured data sources, it includes a built-in natural language to SQL capability, allowing you to generate query commands without relocating the data.\\nLearn more about how to implement Knowledge Based in Amazon Bedrock here: https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/aws-bedrock-knowledge-bases\\nGuardrails\\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails is a feature that helps ensure safe, responsible, and aligned use of foundation models by enforcing customizable policies on model outputs. Each guardrail policy is optional and can be enabled based on your application's specific needs. Policies include content filters, denied topics, sensitive information filters, and contextual grounding checks.\\nYou are charged based on the types of policies enabled. For example, if you enable content filters and denied topics, you will incur charges for both; however, enabling sensitive information filters does not generate any additional charges.\\nGuardrail usage is measured in text units, with one unit consisting of up to 1,000 characters. Inputs longer than 1,000 characters are split into multiple text units. For instance, a 5,600-character input would be billed as six text units.\\nContextual grounding checks compare a reference source and a user query against the model’s response to verify that the output is both relevant and grounded. In this case, the total characters from the source, query, and model response are combined to calculate the number of text units billed.\\nGuardrails policy*Price\\nContent filters (text content)$0.15 per 1,000 text units\\nContent filters (image content)$0.00075 per image processed\\nDenied topics$0.15 per 1,000 text units\\nSensitive information filters$0.10 per 1,000 text units\\nSensitive information filters (regular expression)Free\\nWord filters Free\\nContextual grounding check$0.10 per 1,000 text units\\nModel Evaluation\\nAmazon Bedrock model evaluation helps you compare and assess the performance of different foundation models for your specific use case. You can evaluate models using automatically generated algorithmic scores or human-based evaluations.\\nModel evaluation is billed based on the inference costs of the models you choose to test. Algorithmic scores—such as relevance, coherence, and fluency—are provided automatically and at no additional cost. If you choose to conduct human-based evaluations using your own review workflow, you'll be charged for the model inference plus $0.21 per completed human evaluation task.\\nData Automation\\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation is an integrated parsing solution within Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that enhances the relevance and accuracy of responses from multimodal data sources. When configuring a Knowledge Base, you can choose Bedrock Data Automation as your parsing method to automatically extract insights from documents, images, and other rich media—including figures, charts, and diagrams.\\nAs documents and images are ingested, Bedrock Data Automation analyzes the content and extracts structured information, which is then used in downstream steps such as chunking, embedding, and storage. This standardized output helps improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows within Knowledge Bases.\\nPricing is based on the number of units processed (pages, images, or audio). If the blueprint used to define the fields for extraction contains between 1 and 30 fields, a custom per-unit rate applies. If your blueprint includes more than 30 fields, an additional charge of $0.0005 is applied for each extra field per unit processed.\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing in Amazon Bedrock enables cost and performance optimization by dynamically selecting the most appropriate foundation model from the same model family based on prompt complexity. For instance, within Anthropic’s Claude family, Bedrock can route simple requests to Claude 3 Haiku and more complex ones to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Similarly, it can switch between Meta Llama 3.3 70B and 3.18B, or Nova Pro and Nova Lite, depending on the use case.\\nThe routing engine evaluates each prompt to predict which model will deliver the best balance of quality and efficiency. This is especially valuable for scenarios like customer service assistants, where basic queries can be served by smaller, faster, and lower-cost models, while more advanced queries are directed to more powerful ones. Intelligent Prompt Routing can cut costs by up to 30% without sacrificing response accuracy.\\nPrompt Optimization\\nAmazon Bedrock Prompt Optimization enhances the effectiveness of your generative AI applications by automatically refining input prompts to improve accuracy and relevance. It rewrites or adjusts prompts before they are sent to the foundation model, helping to optimize both performance and cost.\\nYou are charged based on the total number of tokens in both the original input and the optimized prompt. The pricing is $0.030 per 1,000 tokens processed.\\nCost Optimization Tips\\nTo manage costs effectively, consider batching requests to reduce per-unit charges, caching prompts to reuse inputs, and selecting the most efficient model for your use case. If your usage is predictable, reserving provisioned throughput can significantly lower hourly rates.\\nAdditional Charges\\nBeyond model and inference fees, you may incur costs for data transfers across regions, storing custom models monthly, or running evaluation tools for monitoring and testing. These charges can add up and should be factored into your overall deployment budget.\\nBedrock Pricing Summary\\nAmazon Bedrock’s flexible pricing accommodates a wide range of AI use cases, but it is important to match your architecture and usage with the right pricing model. With smart planning, including balancing on-demand versus provisioned throughput, using caching, and choosing the right models, teams can build and scale generative AI applications while keeping costs under control.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nSimilar posts\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nWhat is Amazon Bedrock?\\nDiscover how Amazon Bedrock simplifies AI development with serverless access to top foundation models, customizable options, and cost-efficient...\\nJoaquin Lippincott, CEO  May 7, 2025 \\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nHow do I pick the right GenAI Model?\\nLearn how to choose the right GenAI model for your business with insights on AWS Bedrock and key industry players.

See empirical evidence and learn how this upgrade benefits AI applications still using it.\\nbedrockclaudeclaude3anthropicanthropic-claude\\n\\nJonathan Evans\\nAmazon Employee\\nPublished Mar 27, 2025\\n|\\nLast Modified Mar 28, 2025\\nLike (1)1\\nComments\\nShare\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet v2: Double the Output Capacity with 8k Token Limit\\nWhy Output Token Limits Matter\\nThe Experiment\\nSetup\\nResults\\nVisual Comparison\\nImplications for Developers\\nConclusion\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet v2: Double the Output Capacity with 8k Token Limit\\n\\nWhile Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now somewhat legacy with the release of Claude 3.7, many developers still use it in their applications. If you're among those continuing to use Claude 3.5, you should know that Anthropic's previous flagship mid-size model on Amazon Bedrock received a significant upgrade over v1. The new version (v2) doubles the output token limit from 4k to 8k tokens while maintaining the same pricing. This post provides empirical evidence of this improvement and demonstrates how it benefits developers still building with Claude 3.5 on Amazon Bedrock.\\n\\nWhy Output Token Limits Matter\\nOutput token limits constrain how much content an AI model can generate in a single response. For applications requiring detailed explanations, code examples, or comprehensive analyses, having a higher output limit means:\\n\\n\\nFewer API calls to get complete responses\\n\\n\\nMore comprehensive answers in a single interaction\\n\\n\\nReduced latency from fewer round trips\\n\\n\\nBetter user experience with cohesive outputs\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Experiment\\nI designed a simple experiment to verify the difference between Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 and v2 by:\\n\\n\\nCreating an identical prompt that would push both models to their limits\\n\\n\\nUsing the AWS Bedrock `converse` API with identical settings\\n\\n\\nMeasuring the actual token usage and stop reasons\\n\\n\\nComparing the completeness of responses\\n\\n\\nYou can find a notebook running through this experiment for your own testing at the Anthropic on AWS Github Repo: Here\\n\\nSetup\\nI used the following model IDs for testing:\\n```\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4  \\nmodels = {\\n    \\\"Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1\\\": \\\"us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\\\",  # 4k output token limit\\n    \\\"Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2\\\": \\\"us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0\\\"   # 8k output token limit\\n}\\n```\\nAnd created a prompt asking for a verbose response:\\n```\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4  \\ninput_text = \\\"\\\"\\\"While writing unit tests in Jest for TypeScript code, I want to check the values \\nof variables in a function while running the test. How to modify the functions? Give 20 detailed \\nexamples, each with a different example function and the corresponding test. Ensure all 20 examples \\nare highly detailed. Provide all examples in one response.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\nResults\\nThe results were definitive:\\n| Model | Output Tokens | Input Tokens | Stop Reason |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 | 4096 | 128 | max_tokens |\\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 | 6270 | 128 | end_turn |\\nBoth models attempted to complete the task but Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 hit it's respective output token limit. The v2 model was able to generate almost twice as much content as v1 before naturally exiting.\\n\\nVisual Comparison\\n\\nChart showing Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 with 4096 output tokens and v2 with 8192 output tokens\\n\\nImplications for Developers\\nThis doubling of output capacity offers significant advantages:\\n\\n\\nMore comprehensive responses: Get complete answers to complex questions without breaking them into multiple requests\\n\\n\\nMore efficient token usage: Instead of spending tokens on multiple prompt repeats to continue a response, you can get everything in one go\\n\\n\\nBetter for code generation: Code examples, especially with tests (like in our experiment), require significant space to be properly demonstrated\\n\\n\\nImproved documentation tasks: Generate more detailed documentation, tutorials, or explanations in a single response\\n\\n\\nCost efficiency: Same pricing with twice the output capacity means better value\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe upgrade from Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 to v2 represents a significant improvement in output capacity at no additional cost. This means developers can build more sophisticated applications with fewer API calls and better user experiences.\\nFor tasks requiring detailed, lengthy outputs (code generation, documentation, analysis), Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 is now a much more capable solution on Amazon Bedrock.\\nHave you tried Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2?

Our goal is to use AI to simplify the lives of shoppers, sellers, advertisers, enterprises, and everyone in between.\\n\\nAmazon’s new AI Shopping Guides make it easier to research product types and buy smarter. Here’s how. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Amazon simplifies product research, leveraging generative AI to bring together shopping guidance and product recommendations on over 100 product types.\\nAs the next step in our AI journey, we’ve built Amazon Nova, a new generation of foundation models (FMs). With the ability to process text, image, and video as prompts, customers can use Amazon Nova-powered generative AI applications to understand videos, charts, and documents, or generate videos and other multimedia content.\\n“Inside Amazon, we have about 1,000 Gen AI applications in motion, and we’ve had a bird’s-eye view of what application builders are still grappling with,” said Rohit Prasad, SVP of Amazon Artificial General Intelligence. “Our new Amazon Nova models are intended to help with these challenges for internal and external builders, and provide compelling intelligence and content generation while also delivering meaningful progress on latency, cost-effectiveness, customization, information grounding, and agentic capabilities.”\\nThe new Amazon Nova models available in Amazon Bedrock include:  \\n\\nAmazon Nova Micro, a text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses at very low cost.\\nAmazon Nova Lite, a very low-cost multimodal model that is lightning fast for processing image, video, and text inputs.\\nAmazon Nova Pro, a highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost for a wide range of tasks.\\nAmazon Nova Premier, the most capable of Amazon’s multimodal models for complex reasoning tasks and for use as the best teacher for distilling custom models (available in the Q1 2025 timeframe).\\nAmazon Nova Canvas, a state-of-the-art image generation model.\\nAmazon Nova Reel, a state-of-the-art video generation model.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Nova Reel transforms a single image input into a brief video with the prompt: dolly forward.  \\nHow Amazon Nova models will benefit customers\\nAll Amazon Nova models are incredibly capable, fast, cost-effective, and have been designed to be easy to use with a customer’s systems and data. They support a wide range of tasks across 200 languages and multiple modalities. Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro are at least 75 percent less expensive than the best performing models in their respective intelligence classes in Amazon Bedrock. They are also the fastest models in their respective intelligence classes in Amazon Bedrock.\\n\\nAnnouncements and updates from AWS re:Invent 2024 -------------------------------------------------News from AWS re:Invent, including all things generative AI, new service announcements, tech demos, and more.\\nThe models are integrated with Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes high-performing FMs from leading AI companies and Amazon available for use through a single API. Using Amazon Bedrock, customers can easily experiment with and evaluate Amazon Nova models, as well as other FMs, to determine the best model for an application.\\nThe models also support custom fine-tuning, which allows customers to point the models to examples in their own proprietary data that have been labeled to boost accuracy. The Amazon Nova model learns what matters most to the customer from their own data (including text, images, and videos), and then Amazon Bedrock trains a private fine-tuned model that will provide tailored responses.\\nIn addition to supporting fine-tuning, the models also support distillation, which enables the transfer of specific knowledge from a larger, highly capable “teacher model” to a smaller, more efficient model that is highly accurate, but also faster and cheaper to run.\\nAmazon Nova models are integrated with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and excel at Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which enables customers to ensure the best accuracy by grounding responses in an organization’s own data.\\nAmazon Nova models have been optimized to make them easy to use and effective in agentic applications that require interacting with an organization’s proprietary systems and data through multiple APIs to execute multistep tasks.  \\nCreative content generation\\nWith the output quality, intuitive API platform, and advanced customization opportunities, the Amazon Nova creative generation models, Amazon Nova Canvas and Amazon Nova Reel, are helping Amazon Ads remove barriers for sellers and advertisers leading to new levels of creativity and innovation, like using video advertising for the first time, creating display and video campaigns for more products in their catalog, and experimenting with new strategies like keyword-level creative. On average, we’ve seen brands using these tools advertise five times more products and twice as many images per advertised product, shifting budgets to what’s driving the best results.\\nIn this example, Amazon Ads used Amazon Nova Reel to create a video advertisement for a fictional boxed pasta brand. In the whimsical “Pasta City,” buildings are sculpted from towering tubes of cannelloni noodles, the neighborhood is sprinkled with Italian spice landscaping, and the streets are lined with savory marinara sauce, fusilli noodles, and tender meatballs. The ad is an example of how advertisers can bring their products to life and create high-quality content using Amazon Nova models.\\n\\n5 new generative AI tools to accelerate seller growth and enhance the customer shopping experience --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Amazon puts powerful AI tools in the hands of sellers and small businesses to enable their success.\\nVideo understanding\\nTo put the video understanding capabilities of Amazon Nova Pro to the test, we asked the model to review and describe a brief silent video clip of a football game. The results include details about the setting of the game, the team uniforms, descriptions of actions taken by the players, and how the play culminates.\\nVideo via Shutterstock, Inc.\\nVideo Prompt: “Describe the video.”\\nOutput: “The video depicts a football game in progress on a green field. Players from two teams, one in yellow uniforms and the other in white, are engaged in a play. The quarterback from the yellow team throws a pass to a receiver, who catches the ball and begins running downfield. Defenders from the white team pursue him, attempting to tackle him.

While its capabilities are expansive, understanding its pricing structure is key to managing budgets and optimizing deployments. If you are new to GenAI or Bedrock we recommend starting with ourWhat is Amazon Bedrock? article.\\nWhen it comes to pricing there are two major categories of models: text & multimodal models (ChatGPT style models) and creative models which create images and videos.\\nSince Amazon Bedrock currently supports 60+ different models in Bedrock, we are going to focus on our top four picks in the text & multimodal models:\\n\\nAmazon Nova\\nAnthropic's Claude\\nMeta's Llama\\nDeepSeek\\n\\nAnd for creative models Amazon Nova—specifically Canvas & Reels—and Stability AI.\\nAmazon Bedrock Modes\\nYou can run Amazon Bedrock in different modes, each of which offers a different pricing scheme:\\n\\nOn-demand mode\\nBatch mode\\nProvisioned throughput\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nCustom Model Import\\nMarketplace models\\n\\nOn-Demand Mode\\nIn On-Demand mode, you’re only billed for the tokens you use in Amazon Bedrock—no time-based commitments. A token is a small unit of text—typically a few characters—that models use to interpret prompts and user input.\\n\\nFor text-generation models, you pay per input token processed and output token generated.\\nFor embeddings models, you're charged per input token processed.\\nFor image and video-generation models, you pay per image or video created (we will cover this in a different blog post).\\n\\nBatch Mode\\nAmazon Bedrock Batch mode lets you submit a file with multiple prompts and receive a single output file with the corresponding responses—ideal for large-scale, simultaneous predictions. The results are stored in your Amazon S3 bucket for easy access later. Amazon Bedrock supports batch inference with select foundation models from providers like Anthropic, Meta,and Amazon, offering up to 50% lower costs compared to On-Demand pricing. Some models (like DeepSeek) aren't offered in Batch Mode on Bedrock.\\nThe following table breaks down the costs*for the latest models from our top four provides (outlined above):\\n| Anthropic models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache read) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache write) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | N/A | N/A | $0.30 | $3.75 |\\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | $1.50 | $7.50 | $0.30 | $3.75 |\\n| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 | $0.50 | $2.50 | $1.00 | $0.08 |\\n| Amazon Nova models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | Price per 1M input tokens (cache read) |\\n| Amazon Nova Micro | $0.04 | $0.14 | $0.02 | $0.07 | $0.01 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Lite | $0.06 | $0.24 | $0.03 | $0.12 | $0.02 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Pro | $0.80 | $3.20 | $0.40 | $1.60 | $0.20 | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Pro (w/ latency optimized inference) | $1.00 | $4.00 | N/A | N/A | N/A | - |\\n| Amazon Nova Premier | $2.50 | $12.50 | $1.25 | $6.25 | N/A | - |\\n| Meta models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | Price per 1M input tokens (batch) | Price per 1M output tokens (batch) | NA | NA |\\n| Llama 4 Maverick 17B | $0.24 | $0.97 | $0.12 | $0.49 | - | - |\\n| Llama 4 Scout 17B | $0.17 | $0.66 | $0.09 | $0.33 | - | - |\\n| Llama 3.3 Instruct (70B) | $0.72 | $0.72 | $0.36 | $0.36 | - | - |\\n| DeepSeek Models | Price per 1M input tokens | Price per 1M output tokens | NA | NA | NA | NA |\\n| DeepSeek-R1 | $1.35 | $5.40 | - | - | - | - |\\n\\nPricing is for AWS US regions. Pricing for other regions can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/\\n\\nFor more Amazon Bedrock pricing information, as well as token count limits checkout ourpublicly available Google Sheet, which tracks the following information:\\n\\nModel name\\nToken count\\nInputs (Text, Image, Video, audio)\\nOutputs (Text, Image, Video, audio)\\nSupported language #\\nCan be run in Bedrock (yes/no)\\nAllows fine tuning (yes/no)\\nWhether it is deprecated or not\\n\\n\\nProvisioned Throughput\\nProvisioned Throughput mode allows you to reserve model units for a specific base or custom model, making it ideal for large, consistent inference workloads that require guaranteed performance. This is the only mode that supports access to custom models. Each model unit delivers a set level of throughput, measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. Pricing is hourly, with the option to commit to either a 1-month or 6-month term.\\nMore information on purchasing Provisioned throughput can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-thru-purchase.html\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nLatency-optimized inference in Amazon Bedrock delivers faster response times, enhancing the performance of your generative AI applications. This option is available for Amazon Nova Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models. According to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Haiku runs faster on AWS than anywhere else. Similarly, Llama 3.1 models achieve the fastest performance on AWS compared to other major cloud providers.\\nYou can learn more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/latency-optimized-inference.html\\nCustom Model Import\\nCustom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock lets you bring in your previously customized models and run them just like Bedrock’s hosted foundation models—fully managed and available on demand. You can upload custom weights for supported model architectures and serve them using On-Demand mode, with no charge for the import itself. Once imported, the model is ready for use without any additional setup.\\nYou’re only billed for inference, based on the number of model copies needed to handle your traffic and how long each copy remains active, charged in 5-minute increments. A model copy is an instance of your imported model available to handle inference requests. Pricing per minute varies by model architecture, context length, AWS Region, compute unit version, and model copy size tier.\\nDetailed documentation on this approach can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-customization-import-model.html\\nMarketplace models\\nThe Amazon Bedrock Marketplace lets you discover, test, and use over 100 foundation models—including popular, emerging, and specialized options—directly within Bedrock. Models are deployed to dedicated endpoints, where you can choose instance types, set the number of instances, and configure auto-scaling to fit your workload needs.\\nFor proprietary models, pricing includes a software fee set by the model provider (billed per hour, per second, or per request) and an infrastructure fee based on your selected instance type. Pricing is clearly displayed before you subscribe and in the model’s AWS Marketplace listing. For publicly available models, you pay only the infrastructure fee tied to your instance selection.\\nA complete list of Marketplace Models can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-marketplace-model-reference.html\\nOther Pricing Factors\\nBeyond running vanilla versions of models, some models allow for fine tuning and other model distillations.\\nFine Tuning\\nCustomizing models incurs separate costs. Fine-tuning charges are based on data volume. For example,Amazon Nova Pro runs at $0.008 per 1,000 tokens. Fine-tuned models must use provisioned throughput for inference.\\nModel Distillation\\nAmazon Bedrock also allows customers to bring their own pre-trained models through the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature. These are billed by Custom Model Units (CMUs), at $0.0785 per minute per unit. A model using 2 CMUs for five minutes would cost roughly $0.79.\\nOther Tools & Optimization\\nA number of models also have additional tools that can be turned on and they have associated charges. This includes:\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nKnowledge bases\\nGuardrails\\nModel Evaluation\\nData Automation\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing\\nPrompt Optimization\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows is a no-code, visual workflow builder that enables you to design, test, and deploy generative AI applications by connecting foundation models, prompts, agents, and other AWS services into end-to-end solutions.\\nIn Bedrock Flows, you're billed based $0.035 per 1,000 node transitions—each time a node in your workflow executes, it counts as one transition. Charges are calculated from the total transitions across all your flows. Additional costs may apply if your workflow utilizes other AWS services or involves data transfers. For example, invoking an Amazon Bedrock Guardrail policy within your flow incurs charges based on the number of text units the policy processes.\\nLearn more about Amazon Bedrock Flows: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/flows/\\nKnowledge bases\\nTo enhance foundation models (FMs) with current and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)—a method that pulls relevant data from internal sources to improve the accuracy of responses. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a fully managed solution for implementing the entire RAG workflow, including ingestion, retrieval, prompt enrichment, session context management, and source attribution—without the need for custom data integrations. It also enables users to query or summarize a single document without setting up a vector database. For structured data sources, it includes a built-in natural language to SQL capability, allowing you to generate query commands without relocating the data.\\nLearn more about how to implement Knowledge Based in Amazon Bedrock here: https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/aws-bedrock-knowledge-bases\\nGuardrails\\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails is a feature that helps ensure safe, responsible, and aligned use of foundation models by enforcing customizable policies on model outputs. Each guardrail policy is optional and can be enabled based on your application's specific needs. Policies include content filters, denied topics, sensitive information filters, and contextual grounding checks.\\nYou are charged based on the types of policies enabled. For example, if you enable content filters and denied topics, you will incur charges for both; however, enabling sensitive information filters does not generate any additional charges.\\nGuardrail usage is measured in text units, with one unit consisting of up to 1,000 characters. Inputs longer than 1,000 characters are split into multiple text units. For instance, a 5,600-character input would be billed as six text units.\\nContextual grounding checks compare a reference source and a user query against the model’s response to verify that the output is both relevant and grounded. In this case, the total characters from the source, query, and model response are combined to calculate the number of text units billed.\\nGuardrails policy*Price\\nContent filters (text content)$0.15 per 1,000 text units\\nContent filters (image content)$0.00075 per image processed\\nDenied topics$0.15 per 1,000 text units\\nSensitive information filters$0.10 per 1,000 text units\\nSensitive information filters (regular expression)Free\\nWord filters Free\\nContextual grounding check$0.10 per 1,000 text units\\nModel Evaluation\\nAmazon Bedrock model evaluation helps you compare and assess the performance of different foundation models for your specific use case. You can evaluate models using automatically generated algorithmic scores or human-based evaluations.\\nModel evaluation is billed based on the inference costs of the models you choose to test. Algorithmic scores—such as relevance, coherence, and fluency—are provided automatically and at no additional cost. If you choose to conduct human-based evaluations using your own review workflow, you'll be charged for the model inference plus $0.21 per completed human evaluation task.\\nData Automation\\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation is an integrated parsing solution within Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that enhances the relevance and accuracy of responses from multimodal data sources. When configuring a Knowledge Base, you can choose Bedrock Data Automation as your parsing method to automatically extract insights from documents, images, and other rich media—including figures, charts, and diagrams.\\nAs documents and images are ingested, Bedrock Data Automation analyzes the content and extracts structured information, which is then used in downstream steps such as chunking, embedding, and storage. This standardized output helps improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows within Knowledge Bases.\\nPricing is based on the number of units processed (pages, images, or audio). If the blueprint used to define the fields for extraction contains between 1 and 30 fields, a custom per-unit rate applies. If your blueprint includes more than 30 fields, an additional charge of $0.0005 is applied for each extra field per unit processed.\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing\\nIntelligent Prompt Routing in Amazon Bedrock enables cost and performance optimization by dynamically selecting the most appropriate foundation model from the same model family based on prompt complexity. For instance, within Anthropic’s Claude family, Bedrock can route simple requests to Claude 3 Haiku and more complex ones to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Similarly, it can switch between Meta Llama 3.3 70B and 3.18B, or Nova Pro and Nova Lite, depending on the use case.\\nThe routing engine evaluates each prompt to predict which model will deliver the best balance of quality and efficiency. This is especially valuable for scenarios like customer service assistants, where basic queries can be served by smaller, faster, and lower-cost models, while more advanced queries are directed to more powerful ones. Intelligent Prompt Routing can cut costs by up to 30% without sacrificing response accuracy.\\nPrompt Optimization\\nAmazon Bedrock Prompt Optimization enhances the effectiveness of your generative AI applications by automatically refining input prompts to improve accuracy and relevance. It rewrites or adjusts prompts before they are sent to the foundation model, helping to optimize both performance and cost.\\nYou are charged based on the total number of tokens in both the original input and the optimized prompt. The pricing is $0.030 per 1,000 tokens processed.\\nCost Optimization Tips\\nTo manage costs effectively, consider batching requests to reduce per-unit charges, caching prompts to reuse inputs, and selecting the most efficient model for your use case. If your usage is predictable, reserving provisioned throughput can significantly lower hourly rates.\\nAdditional Charges\\nBeyond model and inference fees, you may incur costs for data transfers across regions, storing custom models monthly, or running evaluation tools for monitoring and testing. These charges can add up and should be factored into your overall deployment budget.\\nBedrock Pricing Summary\\nAmazon Bedrock’s flexible pricing accommodates a wide range of AI use cases, but it is important to match your architecture and usage with the right pricing model. With smart planning, including balancing on-demand versus provisioned throughput, using caching, and choosing the right models, teams can build and scale generative AI applications while keeping costs under control.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nSimilar posts\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nWhat is Amazon Bedrock?\\nDiscover how Amazon Bedrock simplifies AI development with serverless access to top foundation models, customizable options, and cost-efficient...\\nJoaquin Lippincott, CEO  May 7, 2025 \\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nHow do I pick the right GenAI Model?\\nLearn how to choose the right GenAI model for your business with insights on AWS Bedrock and key industry players.

You have a choice of two pricing plans for inference: 1. On-Demand and Batch: This mode allows you to use FMs on a pay-as-you-go basis without having to make any time-based term commitments. 2. Provisioned Throughput: This mode allows you to provision sufficient throughput to meet your application's performance requirements in exchange for a time-based term commitment.\\nPricing models\\nOn Demand and Batch\\nWith the On-Demand mode, you only pay for what you use, with no time-based term commitments. For text-generation models, you are charged for every input token processed and every output token generated. For embeddings models, you are charged for every input token processed. A token comprises a few characters and refers to the basic unit of text that a model learns to understand the user input and prompt. For image-generation models, you are charged for every image generated.  \\nCross-region inference: On-Demand mode also supports cross-region inference for some models. It enables developers to seamlessly manage traffic bursts by utilizing compute across different AWS Regions and get higher throughput limits and enhanced resilience. There's no additional charge for using cross-region inference and the price is calculated basis the region you made the request in (source region).\\nWith Batch mode, you can provide a set of prompts as a single input file and receive responses as a single output file, allowing you to get simultaneous large-scale predictions. The responses are processed and stored in your Amazon S3 bucket so you can access them at a later time. Amazon Bedrock offers select foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Amazon for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing. Please refer to model list here.\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nLatency-optimized inference for foundation models in Amazon Bedrock delivers faster response times for models and helps improve responsiveness for your generative AI applications. You can use the use latency-optimized inference for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku model, and Meta's Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models. As verified by Anthropic, with latency-optimized inference on Amazon Bedrock, Claude 3.5 Haiku runs faster on AWS than anywhere else. Additionally, with latency-optimized inference in Bedrock, Llama 3.1 405B and 70B runs faster on AWS than any other major cloud provider. Learn more here.\\nProvisioned Throughput\\nWith the Provisioned Throughput mode, you can purchase model units for a specific base or custom model. The Provisioned Throughput mode is primarily designed for large consistent inference workloads that need guaranteed throughput. Custom models can only be accessed using Provisioned Throughput. A model unit provides a certain throughput, which is measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. With the Provisioned Throughput pricing, you are charged by the hour, you have the flexibility to choose between 1-month or 6-month commitment terms.\\nCustom Model Import\\nCustom Model Import allows you to leverage your prior model customization investments within Amazon Bedrock and consume them in the same fully-managed manner as Bedrock’s existing hosted foundation models. You can import custom weights for supported model architectures and serve the custom model using On-Demand mode. There is no charge to import a custom model to Bedrock. Once you import a model, you will be able to access it on-demand without requiring to perform any control plane action. You are only charged for model inference, based on the number of copies of your custom model required to service your inference volume and the duration each model copy is active, billed in 5-minute windows. A model copy is a single instance of an imported model ready to serve inference requests. The price per model copy per minute depends on factors such as architecture, context length, AWS Region, compute unit version (hardware generation), and is tiered by model copy size.\\nMarketplace models\\nAmazon Bedrock Marketplace allows you to discover, test, and use over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized foundation models in Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock Marketplace models are deployed to endpoints where you can select your desired number of instances and instance types as well as configure your auto-scaling policies to meet the demands of your workload. For proprietary models, you are charged the software price set by the model provider (per hour, billable in per second increments, or per request) and an infrastructure price based on the instance you select. You can see these prices prior to subscribing to the provider model and also from the model listing in AWS Marketplace. For publicly available models, you are charged only the infrastructure price based on the instance you select. Learn more here.\\nCustomization and optimization\\nModel Customization\\nWith Amazon Bedrock, you can customize FMs with your data to deliver tailored responses for specific tasks and your business context. You can fine-tune models with labeled data or using continued pretraining with unlabeled data. For customization of a text-generation model, you are charged for the model training based on the total number of tokens processed by the model (number of tokens in the training data corpus x the number of epochs) and for model storage charged per month per model. An epoch refers to one full pass through your training dataset during fine-tuning or continued pretraining. Inferences using customized models are charged under the Provisioned Throughput plan and requires you purchase Provisioned Throughput. One model unit is made available with no commitment term for inference on a customized model. You will be charged for the number of hours you use in the first model unit for custom model inference. If you want to increase your throughput beyond one model unit, then you must purchase a 1-month or 6-month commitment term.\\nModel Distillation\\nWith Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation you pay for what you use. Synthetic data generation is charged at on-demand pricing of the selected teacher model. Fine-tuning of the student model is charged at model customization rates. Since a distilled model is a customized model, inferences using customized models are charged under the Provisioned Throughput plan and requires customers to purchase Provisioned Throughput.\\nPrompt Caching\\nWith prompt caching on Amazon Bedrock, you can cache repeated context across API calls to reduce your costs and response latencies. Prompts often contain common context or prefixes such as long, multi-turn conversations, many-shot examples and detailed instructions that refine model behavior. Using existing Amazon Bedrock APIs, you can specify the prompt prefixes that you want to cache for five minutes in an AWS account-specific cache. During that time, any requests with matching prefixes receive a discount of up to 90% on cached tokens and a latency improvement of up to 85%. Prices and performance improvements vary by model and prompt length, but your caches are always isolated to your AWS account.\\nTools\\nGuardrails\\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails helps you to implement customized safeguards and responsible AI policies for your generative AI applications. It provides additional customizable safety protections on top of the native protections offered by FMs. It is the only responsible AI capability offered by a major cloud provider that helps enable customers to build and customize safety, privacy, and truthfulness protections for their generative AI applications in a single solution, and it works with all FMs in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models. Bedrock Guardrails can also be integrated with Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build generative AI applications aligned with your responsible AI policies. Additionally, it offers an ApplyGuardrail API to help evaluate user inputs and model responses generated by any custom or third-party FM outside of Bedrock.\\nKnowledge Bases and Data Automation\\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that enables customers to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from their own data sources. It supports various data sources, including S3, and Confluence, Salesforce, and SharePoint, in preview. It also offers document ingestion for streaming data. Bedrock Knowledge Bases converts unstructured data into embeddings, stores them in vector databases, and enables retrieval from diverse data stores. It also integrates with Kendra for managed retrieval and supports structured data retrieval using natural language to SQL.\\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation transforms unstructured, multimodal content into structured data formats for use cases like intelligent document processing, video analysis, and RAG. Bedrock Data Automation can generate Standard Output content using predefined defaults which are modality specific, like scene-by-scene descriptions of videos, audio transcripts or automated document analysis. Customers can additionally create Custom Outputs by specifying their output requirements in Blueprints based on their own data schema that they can then easily load into an existing database or data warehouse. Through an integration with Knowledge Bases, Bedrock Data Automation can also be used to parse content for RAG applications, improving the accuracy and relevancy of results by including information embedded in both images and text.\\nAgents\\nAmazon Bedrock Agents offer you the ability to build and configure autonomous agents within your application. These agents securely connect to your company's data sources and augment user requests with the right information to generate accurate responses. You can create a single and multi-agent application with just a few quick steps, accelerating the time it takes to build generative AI applications. These agents support code interpretation to dynamically generate and execute code as well as return of control, which allows you to define an action schema and get the control back whenever the agent invokes the action. Additionally, Amazon Bedrock Agents can retain memory across interactions, offering more personalized and seamless user experiences.\\nFlows\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows is a workflow authoring and execution feature of Bedrock for generative AI applications. It accelerates the creation, testing, and deployment of user-defined generative AI workflows through an intuitive visual builder and a set of APIs. It allows you to seamlessly link the latest foundation models, Prompts, Agents, Knowledge Base, Guardrails, and AWS services (such as Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3) along with business logic to build generative AI workflows. You can easily test and version your workflows, and run it in a secure serverless environment through a visual interface or API without having to stand up your own infrastructure.\\nEvaluations\\nModel Evaluation: With Amazon Bedrock model evaluation you pay for what you use, with no minimum volume commitments on the number of prompts or responses. For automatic (programmatic) evaluation, you only pay for the inference from your choice of model in the evaluation. The automatically-generated algorithmic scores are provided at no extra charge. During the Public Preview for automatic (Model/LLM-as-a-judge) evaluation, you only pay for the inference from your choice of generator model and evaluator model. In an LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation job, the built-in metrics use system judge prompt templates unique to each metric and available judge model that will be charged as part of your token usage, and the judge prompts are available in the public AWS documentation for transparency. For human-based evaluation where you bring your own workteam, you are charged for the model inference in the evaluation, and a charge of $0.21 per completed human task. A human task is defined as an instance of a human worker submitting an evaluation of a single prompt and its associated inference responses in the human evaluation user interface. The price is the same whether you have one or two models in your evaluation job and also the same regardless of how many evaluation metrics and rating methods you include. The charges for the human tasks will appear under the Amazon SageMaker section in your AWS bill and are the same for all AWS Regions. There is no separate charge for the workforce, as the workforce is supplied by you. For an evaluation managed by AWS, pricing is customized for your evaluation needs in a private engagement while working with the AWS expert evaluations team.\\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Evaluation (RAG evaluation): With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Evaluation (RAG evaluation) you pay for what you use, with no minimum volume commitments on the number of prompts or responses. During the Public Preview, you only pay for the inference from your choice of generator model and evaluator model (the evaluation job uses an LLM-as-a-judge), as well as any charges incurred from using the Knowledge Base in the evaluation job according to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases pricing. In a Knowledge Base Evaluation (RAG evaluation) job, the built-in metrics use system judge prompt templates unique to each metric and available judge model that will be charged as part of your token usage, and the judge prompts are available in the public AWS documentation for transparency. Some metrics involve doing judge model inference on retrieved context from your Knowledge Base or your ground truth answers in addition to the input prompt, which affects the costs associated with each metric - more information on each metric can be found in the public AWS documentation for evaluations.\\nPricing details\\nPricing is dependent on the modality, provider, and model. Please select the model provider to see detailed pricing.\\nAmazon Bedrock offers select foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Amazon for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing.

The maximum throughput and concurrency limit per model copy depends on factors such as input/output token mix, hardware type, model size, architecture, inference optimizations, and is determined during the model import workflow.\\nBedrock automatically scales the number of model copies depending on your usage patterns. If there are no invocations for a 5-minute period, Bedrock will scale down to zero and scale back up when you invoke your model. While scaling back up, you may experience a cold-start duration (in tens of seconds) depending on model size. Bedrock also scales up the number of model copies if your inference volume consistently exceeds the concurrency limits of a single model copy. Note: There is a default maximum of 3 model copies per account per imported model that can be increased through Service Quotas.\\n\\n\\nPricing tools (details)\\n\\n\\nFlows\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Bases\\n\\n\\nGuardrails\\n\\n\\nModel Evaluation\\n\\n\\nData Automation\\n\\n\\nFlows\\n\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nYou are charged based on the number of node transitions required to execute your application.

The model storage costs for 2 Custom Model Units would be $3.90 for the month.\\nThere is no charge to import the model. The first successful invocation is at 8:03 AM, at which time the metering starts. The 5-minute metering windows are from 8:03 AM - 8:07 AM; 8:07 AM - 8:11 AM, and so on. If there is at least one invocation during any 5-minute period, the window will be considered active for billing. If there is an invocation at 8:03 AM and no further invocations after 8:07 AM, the metering will stop at 8:07 AM.

The flow includes an Input node that takes in an S3 location, and a S3 retrieval node that retrieves 10 files that include articles from 10 major news agency in S3 (2 node transitions). It then uses an iterator node to invoke a model with a prompt node to summarize each file (+ 10 files x 2 node transitions). It then collects all the results using a collector node, write the results to S3 using S3 storage node, and complete in an Output node (+ 3 node transition). They run this flow every half hour of every week day.\\nThe number of node transition per flow execution is: 2+1+10*2 + 3 = 25 node transitions/flow execution\\nThe number of flow execution per month is: 24 hours *2* 5 days * 4 weeks = 960 flow executions/month.\\nTotal monthly bill is: 25 * 960 * $0.035/1000 = $0.84\\nAdditional charges\\nThe bill will also include additional charges for AWS services used in the workflow execution, including Amazon S3 usages in the retrieval and storage nodes, and Amazon Bedrock foundation model usage in the prompt node.\\n\\n\\nData Automation\\nPricing example 1:\\nLet’s say you process a 1,000 page document using BDA Custom Output.

Note, cost structures differ between the Knowledge Bases parsing options. BDA uses per-page pricing, while Foundational Model parsers charge based on input and output tokens. For context, processing 1,000 pages, where 30% contain tables and 30% contain figures, typically requires 2,900 input tokens and 750 output tokens. Token consumption varies by content type, so customers are encouraged to test using their own data to get more accurate estimates. Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Bedrock Data Automation integration uses standard output, where the per page price is $0.010. The total cost would be $10.\\nTotal pages processed = 1,000\\nPrice per page for standard output = $0.010\\nTotal charge = 1,000 * $0.010 = $10\\nPricing example 4:\\nLet’s say you process a 60 minute video using BDA Standard Output.

The processing cost for the first 1,000 images using blueprint 1 is $5.00. The processing cost for the second 1,000 images using blueprint 2 is $10.00. The total cost of processing all 2,000 images would be $15.00  \\nCost for first 1000 images = 1,000 images * $0.005 per image = $5.00\\nCost for second 1,000 images = 1,000 images * ($0.005 + (# of additional fields above 30 *$0.0005 per field))\\n\\\\= 1,000 * ($0.005 + ((40-30)*$0.0005))\\n\\\\= 1,000 * ($0.005 + (10*$0.0005)) = $10.00\\nTotal cost = $5.00 + $10.00 = $15.00\\nPricing example 6:\\nLet’s assume that you want to use Bedrock Data Automation Standard Output to process 15,000 minutes of meeting audio recordings in your organization.

This AI research company based in San Francisco creates products focusing on safety and the long-term benefit of humanity.\\nClaude models are known for their nuanced reasoning and detailed analysis capabilities compared to similar AI chatbots. Claude has several versions with varying accuracy, speed, and cost. Explore the differences between them to more knowledgeably select the right one for your next task.\\n\\nClaude Instant 1.2 and Claude 2: The Early models\\nThese are some of Anthropic’s earlier models. They are now considered legacy options, with the Claude 3 family recommended for most tasks.\\nClaude Instant 1.2 is the predecessor of Claude Haiku, built for efficient processing. Claude 2 and 2.1 were the antecedents to Claude 3, with the second version improving accuracy.\\nThese early Claude varieties are valued for their easy conversations and safety, as they are harder to prompt to dangerous or offensive output than products from other developers. They also stand out among similar AI chatbots for their coding skills.\\nHere’s an overview of these models’ capabilities:\\n\\nCost: Claude Instant 1.2 costs $0.80 per million token input and $2.40 per million token output. Both Claude 2 models are significantly more expensive, costing $8.00 per million token input and $24.00 per million token output.\\nContext window: Claude Instant 1.2 and Claude 2 have a window of 100,000 tokens, while Claude 2.1 has a 200,000 token window. The max output of all versions is 4,096 tokens — or about 3,100 words. \\nKnowledge cutoff: The training data for all three models cuts off in early 2023, meaning other products are a better choice for tasks requiring the latest information.\\nOutput quality: These models all deliver strong performance, but Claude Instant 1.2 prioritizes speed and cost-effectiveness primarily, while Claude 2 focuses more on performance. \\nSpeed: These models are slower than similar counterparts in the Claude 3 family. Claude 2 has an average output of 30 tokens per second and a latency of 0.82 seconds. Claude 2.1 has a slower output of 14.1 tokens per second and a higher latency of 1.29 seconds.\\n\\nClaude 3 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Haiku: Fastest models \\n\\nThese models are the fastest and most compact in Anthropic’s Claude 3 family. They work well for simple queries, delivering results almost instantly. The responses mimic human interaction well. Claude 3.5 is the next generation of Claude’s fastest model. It brings increased accuracy, surpassing Claude 3 Opus in certain contexts.\\nSee how the Haiku models compare in key characteristics:\\n\\nCost: Claude 3 Haiku is cheaper than any previous Claude version, costing $0.25 per million token input and $1.25 per million token output. Claude 3.5 Haiku is slightly more expensive, at $0.80 per million input tokens and $4.00 per million output tokens. This slight added price brings an extensive increase in quality. \\nContext window: Like Claude 2.1, both Haiku models have a context window of 200,000 tokens. The max output of Claude 3 Haiku is 4,096 tokens, while 3.5 Haiku doubles this output at 8,192 tokens — or about 6,200 words. \\nKnowledge cutoff: Claude 3 Haiku has slightly more recent knowledge than earlier models, with a cutoff in August 2023. Claude 3.5 Haiku uses the most recent information of any existing Claude AI chatbot, with a cutoff of July 2024. \\nOutput quality: While the Haiku models are most known for their speed, they still bring accuracy and intelligence to tasks. \\nSpeed: Both Haiku models are significantly faster than Anthropic’s earlier versions. Claude 3 Haiku has an output of 123.1 tokens per second and a latency of 0.71 seconds. Claude 3.5 Haiku generates 65.2 tokens per second and has a latency of 0.70 seconds. \\n\\nClaude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Strong all-around performers\\nThose seeking a balance of performance and accuracy will gain the most value from Claude Sonnet. Claude 3 Sonnet works well for enterprise applications, offering excellent performance while managing costs.\\nYou can utilize it for everything from customer support to complex coding tasks. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is Anthropic’s most intelligent release while maintaining fast speeds.\\nCompare Sonnet to other Anthropic models:\\n\\nCost: The increased performance comes with a higher cost compared to Haiku — $3.00 per million input tokens and $15.00 per million output tokens. However, this cost is still cheaper than the earlier Claude 2 models. \\nContext window: Like all other Claude 3 and 3.5 models, Sonnet operates with a context window of 200,000 tokens. The max output is the same for all three models, at 4,096 tokens, while the 3.5 model operates at 8,192 tokens. \\nKnowledge cutoff: The knowledge cutoff for 3 Sonnet is the same as 3 Haiku and 3 Opus. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a slightly earlier cutoff than 3.5 Haiku of April 2024.\\nOutput quality: Sonnet models balance quality and speed, making them a good general-purpose choice, especially for high-use applications like data processing or sales tasks. Claude 3.5 Sonnet brings significant quality improvements while still maintaining fast speeds. \\nSpeed: The increase in quality slightly decreases the speed of Sonnet compared to Haiku. Claude 3 Sonnet has an output speed of 66.9 tokens per second and a latency of 0.72 seconds. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has an output of 72.3 tokens per second and a latency of 0.97 seconds. \\n\\nClaude 3 Opus: Effective for highly complex tasks\\nClaude 3 Opus is the most intelligent member of the Claude 3 family. It performs well on highly complex tasks, such as open-ended prompts. Compared to other Claude 3 models, it brings enhanced fluency and a more human-like understanding.\\nIts performance is summarized below:\\n\\nCost: This model is Anthropic’s most expensive at $15.00 per million input tokens and $75.00 per one million output tokens. \\nContext window: Opus has the same context window as all Claude 3 and 3.5 models, with 200,000 million input tokens and a maximum output of 4,096.\\nKnowledge cutoff: Like other Claude 3 iterations, Opus has a knowledge cutoff of August 2023. \\nOutput quality: This version is ideal for tasks where quality and detail matter. Potential applications include advanced strategy and detailed research reviews.  \\nSpeed: Since speed is not a priority for this model, it is slower than Haiku or Opus. Its output speed is 25.9 tokens per second, and its latency is 2.09 seconds. It spends time thinking through prompts before offering a response.\\n\\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet: Best for Advanced Reasoning and Versatility\\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic’s latest addition, designed to deliver a new level of reasoning and adaptability. This model introduces an innovative feature called “extended thinking mode,” allowing users to toggle between quick, concise responses and detailed, step-by-step analysis tailored to complex tasks. It combines the strengths of earlier Sonnet models with improved precision, making it ideal for both general-purpose and high-level applications.\\nHere’s how Claude 3.7 Sonnet compares to other Anthropic models:\\n\\nCost: Claude 3.7 Sonnet maintains the standard pricing structure of $3.00 per million input tokens and $15.00 per million output tokens. For extended reasoning tasks, additional “thinking tokens” are factored into the cost, allowing users to balance speed, quality, and budget.\\nContext window: With a context window of up to 128,000 tokens, Claude 3.7 Sonnet provides extensive capacity for handling large inputs. By default, it supports a maximum output of 64,000 tokens, empowering users to work with more extensive and detailed prompts.\\nKnowledge cutoff: While not explicitly confirmed, Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s knowledge cutoff is expected to align with or surpass the dates of earlier 3.5 models, such as April or July 2024.\\nOutput quality: This release builds upon previous Sonnet models with enhanced reasoning and coding capabilities. It performs exceptionally well in advanced tasks like math problem-solving, competitive programming, and detailed research reviews. Claude 3.7 Sonnet consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks, including SWE-bench Verified and TAU-bench.\\nSpeed: Users can adjust the model’s “thinking budget” to prioritize either speed or depth. In standard mode, it delivers rapid, high-quality responses, while extended thinking mode ensures highly detailed, well-reasoned answers. This flexibility makes it an excellent choice for both quick-turnaround tasks and intricate problem-solving.\\n\\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet’s hybrid reasoning capabilities make it one of the most versatile models in Anthropic’s lineup. Whether you need fast answers, in-depth analysis, or a balance of the two, this model offers exceptional performance and adaptability for a wide range of use cases.\\n\\nHow to choose the right model\\nWith the many Claude models available, you may wonder about the right choice for each task. Anthropic has made the process slightly more manageable by dividing its most recent creations into speed, accuracy, and cost categories.\\nHaiku models have the most efficiency with the lowest cost, while Opus is the most intelligent with a higher cost.

      "Understand Amazon Bedrock's flexible AI pricing, optimize costs, and explore provisioning options for deploying generative AI with foundation models on AWS.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock—or AWS Bedrock—offers a powerful, fully managed platform for deploying generative AI using foundation models. While its capabilities are expansive, understanding its pricing structure is key to managing budgets and optimizing deployments. If you are new to GenAI or Bedrock we recommend starting with our What is Amazon Bedrock? article.\n",
      "When it comes to pricing there are two major categories of models: text & multimodal models (ChatGPT style models) and creative models which create images and videos.\n",
      "Since Amazon Bedrock currently supports 60+ different models in Bedrock, we are going to focus on our top four picks in the text & multimodal models:\n",
      "And for creative models Amazon Nova—specifically Canvas & Reels—and Stability AI.\n",
      "You can run Amazon Bedrock in different modes, each of which offers a different pricing scheme:\n",
      "In On-Demand mode, you’re only billed for the tokens you use in Amazon Bedrock—no time-based commitments.  A token is a small unit of text—typically a few characters—that models use to interpret prompts and user input.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock Batch mode lets you submit a file with multiple prompts and receive a single output file with the corresponding responses—ideal for large-scale, simultaneous predictions. The results are stored in your Amazon S3 bucket for easy access later. Amazon Bedrock supports batch inference with select foundation models from providers like Anthropic, Meta,and Amazon, offering up to 50% lower costs compared to On-Demand pricing. Some models (like DeepSeek) aren't offered in Batch Mode on Bedrock.\n",
      "The following table breaks down the costs\\* for the latest models from our top four provides (outlined above):\n",
      "\\* Pricing is for AWS US regions. Pricing for other regions can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/\n",
      "For more Amazon Bedrock pricing information, as well as token count limits checkout our publicly available Google Sheet, which tracks the following information:\n",
      "Provisioned Throughput mode allows you to reserve model units for a specific base or custom model, making it ideal for large, consistent inference workloads that require guaranteed performance. This is the only mode that supports access to custom models. Each model unit delivers a set level of throughput, measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. Pricing is hourly, with the option to commit to either a 1-month or 6-month term.\n",
      "More information on purchasing Provisioned throughput can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-thru-purchase.html\n",
      "Latency-optimized inference in Amazon Bedrock delivers faster response times, enhancing the performance of your generative AI applications. This option is available for Amazon Nova Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models. According to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Haiku runs faster on AWS than anywhere else. Similarly, Llama 3.1 models achieve the fastest performance on AWS compared to other major cloud providers.\n",
      "You can learn more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/latency-optimized-inference.html\n",
      "Custom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock lets you bring in your previously customized models and run them just like Bedrock’s hosted foundation models—fully managed and available on demand. You can upload custom weights for supported model architectures and serve them using On-Demand mode, with no charge for the import itself. Once imported, the model is ready for use without any additional setup.You’re only billed for inference, based on the number of model copies needed to handle your traffic and how long each copy remains active, charged in 5-minute increments. A model copy is an instance of your imported model available to handle inference requests. Pricing per minute varies by model architecture, context length, AWS Region, compute unit version, and model copy size tier.\n",
      "Detailed documentation on this approach can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-customization-import-model.html\n",
      "The Amazon Bedrock Marketplace lets you discover, test, and use over 100 foundation models—including popular, emerging, and specialized options—directly within Bedrock. Models are deployed to dedicated endpoints, where you can choose instance types, set the number of instances, and configure auto-scaling to fit your workload needs.\n",
      "For proprietary models, pricing includes a software fee set by the model provider (billed per hour, per second, or per request) and an infrastructure fee based on your selected instance type. Pricing is clearly displayed before you subscribe and in the model’s AWS Marketplace listing. For publicly available models, you pay only the infrastructure fee tied to your instance selection.\n",
      "A complete list of Marketplace Models can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-marketplace-model-reference.html\n",
      "Beyond running vanilla versions of models, some models allow for fine tuning and other model distillations.\n",
      "Customizing models incurs separate costs. Fine-tuning charges are based on data volume. For example, Amazon Nova Pro runs at $0.008 per 1,000 tokens. Fine-tuned models must use provisioned throughput for inference.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock also allows customers to bring their own pre-trained models through the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature. These are billed by Custom Model Units (CMUs), at $0.0785 per minute per unit. A model using 2 CMUs for five minutes would cost roughly $0.79.\n",
      "A number of models also have additional tools that can be turned on and they have associated charges. This includes:\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock Flows is a no-code, visual workflow builder that enables you to design, test, and deploy generative AI applications by connecting foundation models, prompts, agents, and other AWS services into end-to-end solutions.In Bedrock Flows, you're billed based $0.035 per 1,000 node transitions—each time a node in your workflow executes, it counts as one transition. Charges are calculated from the total transitions across all your flows. Additional costs may apply if your workflow utilizes other AWS services or involves data transfers. For example, invoking an Amazon Bedrock Guardrail policy within your flow incurs charges based on the number of text units the policy processes.\n",
      "Learn more about Amazon Bedrock Flows: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/flows/\n",
      "To enhance foundation models (FMs) with current and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)—a method that pulls relevant data from internal sources to improve the accuracy of responses. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a fully managed solution for implementing the entire RAG workflow, including ingestion, retrieval, prompt enrichment, session context management, and source attribution—without the need for custom data integrations. It also enables users to query or summarize a single document without setting up a vector database. For structured data sources, it includes a built-in natural language to SQL capability, allowing you to generate query commands without relocating the data.\n",
      "Learn more about how to implement Knowledge Based in Amazon Bedrock here: https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/aws-bedrock-knowledge-bases \n",
      "Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is a feature that helps ensure safe, responsible, and aligned use of foundation models by enforcing customizable policies on model outputs. Each guardrail policy is optional and can be enabled based on your application's specific needs. Policies include content filters, denied topics, sensitive information filters, and contextual grounding checks.\n",
      "You are charged based on the types of policies enabled. For example, if you enable content filters and denied topics, you will incur charges for both; however, enabling sensitive information filters does not generate any additional charges.\n",
      "Guardrail usage is measured in text units, with one unit consisting of up to 1,000 characters. Inputs longer than 1,000 characters are split into multiple text units. For instance, a 5,600-character input would be billed as six text units.\n",
      "Contextual grounding checks compare a reference source and a user query against the model’s response to verify that the output is both relevant and grounded.

      "Amazon Bedrock model evaluation helps you compare and assess the performance of different foundation models for your specific use case. You can evaluate models using automatically generated algorithmic scores or human-based evaluations.Model evaluation is billed based on the inference costs of the models you choose to test. Algorithmic scores—such as relevance, coherence, and fluency—are provided automatically and at no additional cost. If you choose to conduct human-based evaluations using your own review workflow, you'll be charged for the model inference plus $0.21 per completed human evaluation task.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is an integrated parsing solution within Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that enhances the relevance and accuracy of responses from multimodal data sources. When configuring a Knowledge Base, you can choose Bedrock Data Automation as your parsing method to automatically extract insights from documents, images, and other rich media—including figures, charts, and diagrams.\n",
      "As documents and images are ingested, Bedrock Data Automation analyzes the content and extracts structured information, which is then used in downstream steps such as chunking, embedding, and storage. This standardized output helps improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows within Knowledge Bases.\n",
      "Pricing is based on the number of units processed (pages, images, or audio). If the blueprint used to define the fields for extraction contains between 1 and 30 fields, a custom per-unit rate applies. If your blueprint includes more than 30 fields, an additional charge of $0.0005 is applied for each extra field per unit processed.\n",
      "Intelligent Prompt Routing in Amazon Bedrock enables cost and performance optimization by dynamically selecting the most appropriate foundation model from the same model family based on prompt complexity. For instance, within Anthropic’s Claude family, Bedrock can route simple requests to Claude 3 Haiku and more complex ones to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Similarly, it can switch between Meta Llama 3.3 70B and 3.18B, or Nova Pro and Nova Lite, depending on the use case.The routing engine evaluates each prompt to predict which model will deliver the best balance of quality and efficiency. This is especially valuable for scenarios like customer service assistants, where basic queries can be served by smaller, faster, and lower-cost models, while more advanced queries are directed to more powerful ones. Intelligent Prompt Routing can cut costs by up to 30% without sacrificing response accuracy.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock Prompt Optimization enhances the effectiveness of your generative AI applications by automatically refining input prompts to improve accuracy and relevance. It rewrites or adjusts prompts before they are sent to the foundation model, helping to optimize both performance and cost.You are charged based on the total number of tokens in both the original input and the optimized prompt. The pricing is $0.030 per 1,000 tokens processed.\n",
      "To manage costs effectively, consider batching requests to reduce per-unit charges, caching prompts to reuse inputs, and selecting the most efficient model for your use case. If your usage is predictable, reserving provisioned throughput can significantly lower hourly rates.\n",
      "Beyond model and inference fees, you may incur costs for data transfers across regions, storing custom models monthly, or running evaluation tools for monitoring and testing. These charges can add up and should be factored into your overall deployment budget.\n",
      "Amazon Bedrock’s flexible pricing accommodates a wide range of AI use cases, but it is important to match your architecture and usage with the right pricing model. With smart planning, including balancing on-demand versus provisioned throughput, using caching, and choosing the right models, teams can build and scale generative AI applications while keeping costs under control.\n",

You have a choice of two pricing plans for inference: 1. On-Demand and Batch: This mode allows you to use FMs on a pay-as-you-go basis without having to make any time-based term commitments. 2. Provisioned Throughput: This mode allows you to provision sufficient throughput to meet your application's performance requirements in exchange for a time-based term commitment.\\nPricing models\\nOn Demand and Batch\\nWith the On-Demand mode, you only pay for what you use, with no time-based term commitments. For text-generation models, you are charged for every input token processed and every output token generated. For embeddings models, you are charged for every input token processed. A token comprises a few characters and refers to the basic unit of text that a model learns to understand the user input and prompt. For image-generation models, you are charged for every image generated.  \\nCross-region inference: On-Demand mode also supports cross-region inference for some models. It enables developers to seamlessly manage traffic bursts by utilizing compute across different AWS Regions and get higher throughput limits and enhanced resilience. There's no additional charge for using cross-region inference and the price is calculated basis the region you made the request in (source region).\\nWith Batch mode, you can provide a set of prompts as a single input file and receive responses as a single output file, allowing you to get simultaneous large-scale predictions. The responses are processed and stored in your Amazon S3 bucket so you can access them at a later time. Amazon Bedrock offers select foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Amazon for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing. Please refer to model list here.\\nLatency Optimized (Public Preview)\\nLatency-optimized inference for foundation models in Amazon Bedrock delivers faster response times for models and helps improve responsiveness for your generative AI applications. You can use the use latency-optimized inference for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku model, and Meta's Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models. As verified by Anthropic, with latency-optimized inference on Amazon Bedrock, Claude 3.5 Haiku runs faster on AWS than anywhere else. Additionally, with latency-optimized inference in Bedrock, Llama 3.1 405B and 70B runs faster on AWS than any other major cloud provider. Learn more here.\\nProvisioned Throughput\\nWith the Provisioned Throughput mode, you can purchase model units for a specific base or custom model. The Provisioned Throughput mode is primarily designed for large consistent inference workloads that need guaranteed throughput. Custom models can only be accessed using Provisioned Throughput. A model unit provides a certain throughput, which is measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. With the Provisioned Throughput pricing, you are charged by the hour, you have the flexibility to choose between 1-month or 6-month commitment terms.\\nCustom Model Import\\nCustom Model Import allows you to leverage your prior model customization investments within Amazon Bedrock and consume them in the same fully-managed manner as Bedrock’s existing hosted foundation models. You can import custom weights for supported model architectures and serve the custom model using On-Demand mode. There is no charge to import a custom model to Bedrock. Once you import a model, you will be able to access it on-demand without requiring to perform any control plane action. You are only charged for model inference, based on the number of copies of your custom model required to service your inference volume and the duration each model copy is active, billed in 5-minute windows. A model copy is a single instance of an imported model ready to serve inference requests. The price per model copy per minute depends on factors such as architecture, context length, AWS Region, compute unit version (hardware generation), and is tiered by model copy size.\\nMarketplace models\\nAmazon Bedrock Marketplace allows you to discover, test, and use over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized foundation models in Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock Marketplace models are deployed to endpoints where you can select your desired number of instances and instance types as well as configure your auto-scaling policies to meet the demands of your workload. For proprietary models, you are charged the software price set by the model provider (per hour, billable in per second increments, or per request) and an infrastructure price based on the instance you select. You can see these prices prior to subscribing to the provider model and also from the model listing in AWS Marketplace. For publicly available models, you are charged only the infrastructure price based on the instance you select. Learn more here.\\nCustomization and optimization\\nModel Customization\\nWith Amazon Bedrock, you can customize FMs with your data to deliver tailored responses for specific tasks and your business context. You can fine-tune models with labeled data or using continued pretraining with unlabeled data. For customization of a text-generation model, you are charged for the model training based on the total number of tokens processed by the model (number of tokens in the training data corpus x the number of epochs) and for model storage charged per month per model. An epoch refers to one full pass through your training dataset during fine-tuning or continued pretraining. Inferences using customized models are charged under the Provisioned Throughput plan and requires you purchase Provisioned Throughput. One model unit is made available with no commitment term for inference on a customized model. You will be charged for the number of hours you use in the first model unit for custom model inference. If you want to increase your throughput beyond one model unit, then you must purchase a 1-month or 6-month commitment term.\\nModel Distillation\\nWith Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation you pay for what you use. Synthetic data generation is charged at on-demand pricing of the selected teacher model. Fine-tuning of the student model is charged at model customization rates. Since a distilled model is a customized model, inferences using customized models are charged under the Provisioned Throughput plan and requires customers to purchase Provisioned Throughput.\\nPrompt Caching\\nWith prompt caching on Amazon Bedrock, you can cache repeated context across API calls to reduce your costs and response latencies. Prompts often contain common context or prefixes such as long, multi-turn conversations, many-shot examples and detailed instructions that refine model behavior. Using existing Amazon Bedrock APIs, you can specify the prompt prefixes that you want to cache for five minutes in an AWS account-specific cache. During that time, any requests with matching prefixes receive a discount of up to 90% on cached tokens and a latency improvement of up to 85%. Prices and performance improvements vary by model and prompt length, but your caches are always isolated to your AWS account.\\nTools\\nGuardrails\\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails helps you to implement customized safeguards and responsible AI policies for your generative AI applications. It provides additional customizable safety protections on top of the native protections offered by FMs. It is the only responsible AI capability offered by a major cloud provider that helps enable customers to build and customize safety, privacy, and truthfulness protections for their generative AI applications in a single solution, and it works with all FMs in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models. Bedrock Guardrails can also be integrated with Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build generative AI applications aligned with your responsible AI policies. Additionally, it offers an ApplyGuardrail API to help evaluate user inputs and model responses generated by any custom or third-party FM outside of Bedrock.\\nKnowledge Bases and Data Automation\\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that enables customers to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from their own data sources. It supports various data sources, including S3, and Confluence, Salesforce, and SharePoint, in preview. It also offers document ingestion for streaming data. Bedrock Knowledge Bases converts unstructured data into embeddings, stores them in vector databases, and enables retrieval from diverse data stores. It also integrates with Kendra for managed retrieval and supports structured data retrieval using natural language to SQL.\\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation transforms unstructured, multimodal content into structured data formats for use cases like intelligent document processing, video analysis, and RAG. Bedrock Data Automation can generate Standard Output content using predefined defaults which are modality specific, like scene-by-scene descriptions of videos, audio transcripts or automated document analysis. Customers can additionally create Custom Outputs by specifying their output requirements in Blueprints based on their own data schema that they can then easily load into an existing database or data warehouse. Through an integration with Knowledge Bases, Bedrock Data Automation can also be used to parse content for RAG applications, improving the accuracy and relevancy of results by including information embedded in both images and text.\\nAgents\\nAmazon Bedrock Agents offer you the ability to build and configure autonomous agents within your application. These agents securely connect to your company's data sources and augment user requests with the right information to generate accurate responses. You can create a single and multi-agent application with just a few quick steps, accelerating the time it takes to build generative AI applications. These agents support code interpretation to dynamically generate and execute code as well as return of control, which allows you to define an action schema and get the control back whenever the agent invokes the action. Additionally, Amazon Bedrock Agents can retain memory across interactions, offering more personalized and seamless user experiences.\\nFlows\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows is a workflow authoring and execution feature of Bedrock for generative AI applications. It accelerates the creation, testing, and deployment of user-defined generative AI workflows through an intuitive visual builder and a set of APIs. It allows you to seamlessly link the latest foundation models, Prompts, Agents, Knowledge Base, Guardrails, and AWS services (such as Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3) along with business logic to build generative AI workflows. You can easily test and version your workflows, and run it in a secure serverless environment through a visual interface or API without having to stand up your own infrastructure.\\nEvaluations\\nModel Evaluation: With Amazon Bedrock model evaluation you pay for what you use, with no minimum volume commitments on the number of prompts or responses. For automatic (programmatic) evaluation, you only pay for the inference from your choice of model in the evaluation. The automatically-generated algorithmic scores are provided at no extra charge. During the Public Preview for automatic (Model/LLM-as-a-judge) evaluation, you only pay for the inference from your choice of generator model and evaluator model. In an LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation job, the built-in metrics use system judge prompt templates unique to each metric and available judge model that will be charged as part of your token usage, and the judge prompts are available in the public AWS documentation for transparency. For human-based evaluation where you bring your own workteam, you are charged for the model inference in the evaluation, and a charge of $0.21 per completed human task. A human task is defined as an instance of a human worker submitting an evaluation of a single prompt and its associated inference responses in the human evaluation user interface. The price is the same whether you have one or two models in your evaluation job and also the same regardless of how many evaluation metrics and rating methods you include. The charges for the human tasks will appear under the Amazon SageMaker section in your AWS bill and are the same for all AWS Regions. There is no separate charge for the workforce, as the workforce is supplied by you. For an evaluation managed by AWS, pricing is customized for your evaluation needs in a private engagement while working with the AWS expert evaluations team.\\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Evaluation (RAG evaluation): With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Evaluation (RAG evaluation) you pay for what you use, with no minimum volume commitments on the number of prompts or responses. During the Public Preview, you only pay for the inference from your choice of generator model and evaluator model (the evaluation job uses an LLM-as-a-judge), as well as any charges incurred from using the Knowledge Base in the evaluation job according to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases pricing. In a Knowledge Base Evaluation (RAG evaluation) job, the built-in metrics use system judge prompt templates unique to each metric and available judge model that will be charged as part of your token usage, and the judge prompts are available in the public AWS documentation for transparency. Some metrics involve doing judge model inference on retrieved context from your Knowledge Base or your ground truth answers in addition to the input prompt, which affects the costs associated with each metric - more information on each metric can be found in the public AWS documentation for evaluations.\\nPricing details\\nPricing is dependent on the modality, provider, and model. Please select the model provider to see detailed pricing.\\nAmazon Bedrock offers select foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Amazon for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing.

The maximum throughput and concurrency limit per model copy depends on factors such as input/output token mix, hardware type, model size, architecture, inference optimizations, and is determined during the model import workflow.\\nBedrock automatically scales the number of model copies depending on your usage patterns. If there are no invocations for a 5-minute period, Bedrock will scale down to zero and scale back up when you invoke your model. While scaling back up, you may experience a cold-start duration (in tens of seconds) depending on model size. Bedrock also scales up the number of model copies if your inference volume consistently exceeds the concurrency limits of a single model copy. Note: There is a default maximum of 3 model copies per account per imported model that can be increased through Service Quotas.\\n\\n\\nPricing tools (details)\\n\\n\\nFlows\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Bases\\n\\n\\nGuardrails\\n\\n\\nModel Evaluation\\n\\n\\nData Automation\\n\\n\\nFlows\\n\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock Flows\\nYou are charged based on the number of node transitions required to execute your application.

What Can You Do With Bedrock? AWS Bedrock Pricing Options And Examples Amazon Bedrock Cost Optimization Best Practices Prevent Overspending On Bedrock With CloudZero Amazon Bedrock FAQs\\nIf you are reading this, you likely understand how Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your organization, from operational efficiency to boosting your bottom line.\\nYet, setting up and running a robust AI infrastructure, including a massive dataset for training and specialized tools, can be expensive.\\nAmazon Bedrock wants to simplify this challenge, enabling you to build generative AI applications faster and easier. But is Amazon Bedrock pricing worth it?\\nWe’ll explore this and other key considerations in the next few minutes.\\nWhat Is AWS Bedrock?\\nAmazon Bedrock simplifies the process of building and scaling generative AI applications. This involves providing your developers with the tools to create secure, compliant, and responsible AI solutions. That’s not all.\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock features\\nThe following Bedrock features highlight the primary problems it solves for building and scaling generative AI applications:\\n1. Simplified access to Foundation Models\\nYour team can choose from a diverse range of FMs to identify the most suitable model for their specific use cases — all through a single API. AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta’s Llama 2, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon itself are contributing their high-performing FMs.\\nThis means you can experiment with and pick the most suitable models for your specific use cases without needing extensive AI model management expertise.\\n2. Supports private model customization\\nYou can use proprietary data with techniques like fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This means you can tailor models to meet specific needs without compromising data security.\\n3. Fully managed serverless infrastructure\\nIts serverless architecture means you won’t need to manage the supporting infrastructure. You can focus on development rather than operational overhead to speed up innovation.\\n4. Solid security and privacy\\nData is encrypted in transit and at rest, and access controls are enforced through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.\\n5. Integrate easily with your AWS stack\\nAmazon Bedrock integrates with existing AWS services, so you can seamlessly incorporate generative AI capabilities into your workflows.\\n6. Rapid prototyping and deployment\\nThe platform also supports quick experimentation and prototyping, swiftly helping your projects move from concept to production.\\n\\nWhat Can You Do With Bedrock?\\nAmazon Bedrock’s managed agents execute various complex business tasks by leveraging their ability to automate multi-step processes and integrate with company systems.\\nOn top of generating text and images, Bedrock agents can also help you:\\n\\nPerform financial due diligence tasks such as analyzing global economic factors, assessing industry trends, and reviewing historical financial data, synthesizing the results into a comprehensive risk profile.\\nAutomate the insurance claims process by collecting information from users, verifying claims against eligibility policies, and managing the workflow of documentation required for claim approvals.\\nHandle complex e-commerce interactions such as updating orders or managing exchanges, responding to customer inquiries about product availability, and executing necessary actions through API calls to the inventory system.\\nAnalyze customer retention data by breaking down the analysis into manageable steps.\\nManage retail operations tasks like demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization.\\n\\nThese capabilities aren’t free, of course. So, how does Amazon Bedrock pricing work?\\nAWS Bedrock Pricing Options And Examples\\nAmazon Bedrock pricing offers two plans: On-Demand (and Batch mode) and Provisioned Throughput mode.\\n\\nThe On-Demand plan lets you access foundation models on a pay-as-you-go basis and is ideal for unpredictable workloads. \\nBatch processing mode is designed for large-scale or periodic batch processing tasks. Also, the plan offers a discounted rate per token processed compared to on-demand pricing. Batch processing mode efficiently handles multiple prompts in a single input file.\\nThe provisioned throughput plan is ideal for consistent high-performance needs, allowing you to provision throughput to meet your workload demands, but this requires a commitment for a one-month or six-month period. The longer your commitment, the lower the rate.\\n\\nThat’s the short answer.\\nHere’s how pricing for Bedrock features actually works, so you’ll know what you are paying for (and optimize your AWS Bedrock costs for maximum ROI).\\nFirst, Amazon Bedrock costs will depend on a couple of factors. These include:\\n\\nThe volume of tokens used: Input or output tokens; billing is calculated per 1,000 tokens.\\nType of operation: For example, generating images costs more than text. \\n\\nFoundation Model: Each of the eight available FMs has a varying pricing structure. For example:\\n\\nAI21 Labs’ five models range from $0.0002 to $0.0188 per 1,000 input or output tokens, depending on the specific model you use.\\nCohere models range from $0.0003 to $0.0020 per 1,000 tokens.\\nStability AI’s SDXL1.0 model charges $49.86 per hour with a one-month commitment or $46.18 per hour with a six-month commitment.\\nAmazon’s models, including pricing for Nova Micro, Nova Lite, and Nova Pro, range from $0.000035 per 1,000 input tokens to $0.0032 per 1,000 output tokens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample Amazon Bedrock pricing for Nova models\\n\\nCompute requirements: More intensive tasks require more compute resources, increasing Amazon Bedrock costs.\\nStorage needs: Keeping datasets and custom models in, say, Amazon S3 has its costs, which vary based on data volume.\\nData transfer charges: During operations, they can also add up, especially if you move a lot of data in and out of Bedrock.\\n\\nYou may incur additional costs if your operations need to work with other AWS services or you utilize other Bedrock tools (Flows, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, Data Automation, and Model Evaluation).\\nWe recommend visiting the official Amazon Bedrock pricing page for the latest pricing details. Also, check the availability page to see which AWS regions and models support Batch inference. Meanwhile, keep reading to learn how to optimize your Amazon Bedrock costs the smarter way.\\nAmazon Bedrock Cost Optimization Best Practices\\nKnowing how Bedrock pricing works can help you prevent its costs from calling the shots in your company.\\nFortunately, we’ve got some practical cost optimization strategies for Bedrick that you can start using right now.\\nOptimize your prompts\\nStreamline prompts to minimize token usage, reducing costs associated with input and output processing. You can also set maximum token limits for model outputs to control response lengths.\\nAlso, consider using prompt caching. By avoiding the need to recompute responses for repeated prompts, prompt caching can reduce costs by up to 90%. This is achieved by minimizing the number of tokens processed and the computational resources required.\\nPrompt caching can also decrease response times significantly, improving user experience in applications that require quick feedback.\\nUsing cached prompts reduces the cost of inference compared to non-cached tokens. For example, cache reads may incur a 90% discount on input token costs.\\nSave up to 50% with batch processing\\nFor large-scale inference tasks that are not time-sensitive, take advantage of batch mode to achieve economies of scale and lower per-unit costs (compared to On-Demand pricing). Better yet, schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours to maximize resource availability and reduce costs further.\\nGet lower rates when you use Provisioned Throughput\\nThis is the Reserved Instances approach for Amazon Bedrock. For applications requiring consistent performance, consider purchasing provisioned throughput with time-based commitments (e.g., one-month or six-month terms) to benefit from reduced rates.\\nUse intelligent prompt routing\\nThe method uses advanced prompt matching and model understanding techniques to predict which model in an FM family will provide the best response quality at the lowest cost for each request.\\nFor instance, it can route requests between different models in the Anthropic Claude family (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku) or between models in the Meta Llama family (e.g., Llama 3.1 70B and 8B) based on the complexity of the prompt.\\nAccess intelligent prompt routing through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs.\\nSee the exact people, products, and processes that drive your Amazon Bedrock costs\\nContinuously track resource usage and costs using native AWS tools like Cost Explorer. Better yet, use robust third-party services like CloudZero. See how Cost Explorer compares to CloudZero here.\\nUnlike most cloud cost optimization tools, CloudZero precisely maps your expenses to the people, products, and processes driving your AWS service costs. Beyond average costs, it also provides insights into cost per customer, per feature, and even per request.\\n\\nThis means you can pinpoint areas where you could improve to cut waste (and boost your bottom line).\\nCloudZero also includes real-time cost anomaly detection. You get timely and contextual alerts to notify your team when spending approaches predefined limits, preventing unexpected overruns.  to see how CloudZero works. Better yet, get your free cloud cost assessment here.\\nMinimize data transfer costs when using Amazon Bedrock\\nConsider the following strategies:\\n\\nRetain data in the same AWS Region as much as possible to avoid the more expensive cross-region transfers.\\nWhen transferring data across regions is necessary, batch your transfers to minimize data movement frequency.\\nUse private IP addresses rather than the more expensive public IPs for internal communications.\\nConsider using AWS CloudFront, the CDN, to cache content closer to users. This can reduce the volume of data transferred from your origin servers.\\n\\nAnd last but by no means least.\\nMake ongoing reviews and optimization a habit\\nConduct regular reviews of workloads and AWS pricing updates to adapt strategies as business needs evolve, ensuring continued cost efficiency. For example, regularly review your data transfer reports through AWS Cost Explorer to identify and eliminate unnecessary transfers.\\nWant more ways to optimize your AI project costs?

That often means AI costs are becoming large, untraceable expenses that are tough to tie back to specific features, products, teams, microservices, etc.\\nNot with CloudZero.\\nCloudZero can allocate 100% of your AI costs programmatically in just minutes or hours, even if you have imperfect tags. This level of proactive visibility prevents overspending (and emergency meetings with the board over surprise costs).\\nNow, it may take time before your AI projects need to turn a profit. But that day is coming. When it does, you’ll be in a much stronger position if you’ve already established the tools to track and manage AI costs. And we are happy to demo these tools for you.  — risk-free, of course.\\nAmazon Bedrock FAQs\\nWhat does Amazon Bedrock do?\\nBedrock is a serverless AI platform on AWS that provides access to tools for building and scaling AI apps through a single API.\\nHow much does Amazon Bedrock cost?\\nAmazon Bedrock pricing varies based on factors such as the model selected, the volume of input/output tokens used, the pricing plan used, the payment option used, and other features.\\nIs Amazon Bedrock cheaper than Azure OpenAI?\\nThat will depend on your usage of either AI platform. However, Bedrock can be cheaper thanks to discounted offers and the efficiency of choosing the supporting models.\\n\\n\\nAuthor: Cody Slingerland\\nCody Slingerland, a FinOps certified practitioner, is an avid content creator with over 10 years of experience creating content for SaaS and technology companies.

Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)\\nThe Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Service Terms, “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content,” and “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties.”\\n1.1. You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.\\n1.2. You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable user, admin, and developer guides) posted on the AWS Site at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html (and any successor or related locations designated by us).\\n1.3. You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.\\n1.4. In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.\\n1.5. You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.\\n1.6. From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.\\n1.7. If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.\\n1.8. You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Services. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.\\n1.9. Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement, and the new AWS Contracting Party will be responsible for issuing any invoices to you after such change, including monthly invoices. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period. You agree to accept invoices from AWS electronically, in a format and method of delivery as determined by AWS, e.g., in a PDF format, as permitted under applicable law.\\nIf, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.\\n1.10. When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.\\n1.11. If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.\\n1.12. If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.\\n1.13. If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.\\n1.14. Data Protection.\\n1.14.1 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).\\n1.14.2 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Supplementary Addendum to the DPA, when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).\\n1.14.3 These Service Terms incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses between controllers and processors (“Controller-to-Processor Clauses”) and the Standard Contractual Clauses between processors (“Processor-to-Processor Clauses”) approved by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 (the “SCCs”). The SCCs will only apply when: (i) the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data; and (ii) Customer Data is transferred either directly or via onward transfer, to a country outside of the European Economic Area not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data subject to GDPR (together a “Data Transfer”). When you are a controller (as defined in the GDPR), the Controller-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer. When you are a processor (as defined in the GDPR), the Processor-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer.\\n1.14.4 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS UK GDPR Addendum to the DPA, when the UK GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process UK Customer Data (as defined in the AWS UK GDPR Addendum), and the AWS Swiss Addendum to the DPA, when the FDPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Swiss Customer Data (as defined in the AWS Swiss Addendum).\\n1.14.5 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS CCPA Terms (“CCPA Terms”), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).\\n1.15. Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the technical documentation applicable to the Services.\\n1.16. Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions.\\n1.17. Payment Currency\\n1.17.1 AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (“Payment Currency”) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the “Currency Service”). When you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service. When using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.\\n1.17.2 When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency. You must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card. If the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.\\n1.17.3 Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). Third-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees. The Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.\\n1.17.4 All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.\\n1.17.5 You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.\\n1.18. By accessing and using AWS Content or the Services, you agree to the terms of the Intellectual Property License.\\n1.19. We will not use Individualized Usage Data or Your Content to compete with your products and services. “Individualized Usage Data” means data about your use of the Services that are specifically identified with your AWS account.\\n1.20. We may use information about how you use and interact with the Services to improve those Services.\\n1.21. Information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources does not constitute Your Content. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items.\\n1.22. Tax Exempt Status\\n1.22.1 To request tax exempt status for your AWS account, you must provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate or other equivalent documentation for the relevant jurisdiction.  You are responsible for updating such documentation so it is accurate at all times.\\n1.22.2 In certain jurisdictions (as noted in the AWS Tax Help pages), you may only use your tax-exempt account to purchase services that are eligible for tax exemption. If you do not use services for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you are responsible for reporting and paying sales and use taxes for that usage directly to the relevant tax authorities to the extent required by law.\\n1.22.3 If you are required by law to pay us using your organization’s funds to qualify for your tax exemption, you warrant that purchases on your account will be made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds.\\n1.22.4 We may, in our sole discretion, reject your request for tax exempt status or revoke the tax exempt status of your account at any time.\\n1.22.5 If you turn on tax settings inheritance, you warrant that the application of any tax exemption on your Management Account to your Organization’s Member Accounts (both as defined in the AWS Organizations section below) complies with applicable tax laws. If a governmental authority determines that the correct amount of tax has not been collected on your purchases, you will assist AWS as necessary (including providing information and documentation as reasonably required) to substantiate your payment of those taxes and promptly reimburse AWS for any associated costs.\\n1.23. If you use any artificial intelligence and machine learning Services, features, and functionality (including third-party models) that we provide, it’s your responsibility to ensure that your use complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and the AWS Responsible AI Policy.\\n1.24. Certain Services may incorporate generative AI features, powered by Amazon Bedrock, that enable you to use prompts to generate output, including: Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CodeCatalyst, Amazon Connect Contact Lens, AWS Database Migration Service, Amazon DataZone, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Q, AWS AppFabric, AWS HealthScribe, and AWS App Studio.\\n1.24.1. The Amazon Bedrock automated abuse detection mechanisms may apply to such services. See here for more details.\\n1.24.2. To improve performance, such services may use cross-region inference, using the optimal AWS Region to process your Content when running model inference. See the applicable service documentation for more details.\\n1.25. You will not use, and will not facilitate or allow End Users to use, the Services to mine cryptocurrency without our prior written approval.\\n1.26. AWS consents to the assignment of an AWS account from one entity to another, subject to the terms of the AWS Account Assignment Requirements, posted here.\\n1.27. To benefit from any contract with AWS enabling you to use AWS Services under the same terms as your affiliate's Agreement solely because your accounts are joined as Member Accounts of their Organization (as defined in the AWS Organizations section below), your AWS Contracting Party must be a signatory to your affiliate's Agreement.\\n2. Betas and Previews\\n2.1. This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related AWS Content (each, a “Beta Service”) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”).\\n2.2. You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you. AWS may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services or Beta Regions at any time. AWS may add, modify, or remove functionality, features, documentation, or other related aspects of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time and these aspects may be different from any generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or Beta Regions.\\n2.3. You may provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.4. AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Unless otherwise communicated to You, any Beta Service or Beta Region made available to You is provided for evaluation purposes and should not be used for processing sensitive data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible and Your Content may not be migrated over to a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.5. Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.\\n2.6. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED.

AWS Outposts\\n4.1. “AWS Outposts” includes AWS Outposts racks and AWS Outposts servers.\\n4.2. Outposts Equipment. AWS will make equipment available to you to support your use of the AWS Outposts Service (the “Outposts Equipment”). AWS or its affiliates maintain all rights in the Outposts Equipment and is not selling, renting, leasing, or transferring any ownership, intellectual or other rights in the Outposts Equipment to you. You will not, and will not purport to, assign, grant, or transfer the Outposts Equipment or any interest in the Outposts Equipment to any individual or entity, and any such purported assignment, grant or transfer is void.\\n4.3. Facility Assessment. You will ensure that, at all times, the facility at which the Outposts Equipment is located (the “Designated Facility”) meets the minimum requirements necessary to support the installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment as described here and otherwise as described in the Outposts technical documentation or indicated to you during the ordering and installation process.\\n4.4. Delivery and Use. You will ensure that you have all necessary rights, certifications, and licenses for the delivery, installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment at the Designated Facility. You are responsible for any damage to the Outposts Equipment while it is at the Designated Facility, unless caused by AWS. AWS may terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment if you breach these terms or materially breach the terms of the Agreement with respect to AWS Outposts. In the event that we terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment in accordance with this Section 4.4, we will provide you with prior notice where practicable under the circumstances.\\n4.5.

AWS Support Options. You will remain enrolled in either Enterprise On-Ramp Support or Enterprise Support during the entire period of your use of AWS Outposts.\\n4.7. Services/SLAs/Security. The Service Terms for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts also apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts. There are inherent differences between Services running locally on AWS Outposts from those Services running at AWS operated facilities because the Outposts Equipment is physically located at the Designated Facility where you are responsible for physical security and access controls, as well as all power, networking, and environmental conditions. Due to these differences:\\na. The Service Level Agreements for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts do not apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts.\\nb. Any AWS commitments in the Agreement that depend on AWS’s operation of such physical security and access controls, or power, networking, and environmental conditions, do not apply to AWS Outposts or any Services running locally on AWS Outposts.\\nc. The specific compliance and assurance programs for which AWS Outposts are in scope are listed here. For other Services listed here, those Services are not in scope when running locally on AWS Outposts unless AWS Outposts is also separately listed for the specific compliance or assurance program.\\n4.8. AWS Outposts servers\\n4.8.1. Installation, Use, and Removal. You are responsible for the installation, use, and removal of the AWS Outposts servers at the Designated Facility and returning the Outposts Equipment to AWS as described in the Outposts technical documentation or as otherwise indicated to you during the ordering process.

If Microsoft increases the license fees it charges for Windows, or if Red Hat increases the license fees it charges for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (“RHEL”), we may make a corresponding increase to the per-hour usage rate (or institute a corresponding per-hour usage rate) for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows or RHEL. Any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows will be made between December 1 and January 31, and we will provide 30 days’ notice. For any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, RHEL, we will provide 30 days’ advance notice. If this happens, you may: (a) continue to use your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL with the new per-hour usage price; (b) convert your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL to comparable EC2 Reserved Instances with Linux; or (c) terminate your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL and receive a pro rata refund of the up-front fee you paid for the terminated EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL.\\n5.4.2. We may terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing programs at any time. Savings Plans and EC2 Dedicated Hosts are nontransferable, and EC2 Reserved Instances are only transferrable in accordance with the requirements of the RI Marketplace provided on the AWS Site. Scheduled Instances and Convertible Reserved Instances are not eligible for the RI Marketplace. Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are noncancellable, and EC2 Dedicated Hosts associated with an active EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation cannot be removed from your account, so you will be charged for the duration of the term you selected, even if you terminate the Agreement. All amounts paid in connection with Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are nonrefundable, except that if we terminate the Agreement other than for cause, terminate an individual EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation type, or terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host pricing program(s), we will refund you a pro rata portion of any up-front fee paid in connection with any previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Hosts. You may not purchase EC2 Reserved Instances for the purpose of reselling them in the RI Marketplace, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. Upon expiration or termination of the term of Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, the reserved pricing will expire and standard on-demand usage prices will apply. You are responsible for determining if you are subject to any limitations arising from the purchase of Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations. For example, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, policies, terms or conditions governing your payment of up-front fees or the expiration of reserved resources, including any fiscal or appropriation laws, or other policies or restrictions governing up-front payments for goods or services.\\n5.5.

Capacity Blocks that you purchase cannot be resold to another party, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. You may not cooperate with any third party in an attempt to influence or manipulate the price for Capacity Blocks. You may not submit requests for Capacity Blocks through any third party (e.g., “proxy purchasing”).\\n5.6. EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) Marketplace.\\n5.6.1. The rights to an active EC2 Reserved Instance can be offered for sale through the RI Marketplace as long as (1) the remaining term on the Reserved Instance is greater than 1 month and (2) your payment of the upfront charge for it has been received and processed (for credit card purchases, 30 days after you have paid the upfront fee, and for invoice purchases, after you have paid the applicable invoice) (a “Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance”). You can be a “Seller” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing, you have a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance associated with your AWS account, and you complete the registration process through your AWS account. You can be a “Buyer” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing. Non-U.S.-based entities may not be Sellers without providing the Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) to establish that you are not a U.S. person. You can resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you previously purchased through the RI Marketplace. You may not resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you purchased through a discount program (Reserved Instance Volume Discounts or otherwise) without obtaining our prior approval.\\n5.6.2. As a Seller, you will be the seller of record of your rights to a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. Except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Buyer. We or our affiliates may also participate in the RI Marketplace as a Seller or a Buyer. We may remove any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance from the RI Marketplace at any time. Once sold and transferred to a Buyer, a Seller will have no rights to that Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance.\\n5.6.3. On Seller’s behalf, we will process all payments for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. “Transaction” means any sale of a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance through the RI Marketplace. “Transaction Proceeds” means the gross sales proceeds received by us from any Transaction. You will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Buyers for Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. We may impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of Transactions that we will process over a period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any Transaction that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise violates these Service Terms, the Agreement, or the Acceptable Use Policy. For each Transaction, we will not remit Transaction Proceeds to a Seller, and the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will not be available to the Buyer, until after we have successfully processed payments for that Transaction from the Buyer.\\n5.6.4. You will not receive any funds collected from payments associated with the hourly prices of your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. At the end of each business day, we will pay to you all due and payable Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to that date. We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.\\n5.6.5. Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation, and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding, and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid (“Taxes”) for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction or remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit, or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.\\n5.6.6. For each Seller, we will collect the necessary data and tax forms to enable compliance with applicable tax laws. For example, for U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain Seller name and address, and may collect the tax identification number and other data as needed to comply with Form 1099K reporting requirements; for non-U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain a Form W-8BEN tax form (which includes name, address, and a signature) as proof that you are exempt from Form 1099K reporting. For each Buyer, we will collect and retain the Buyer’s name and address. Buyers and Sellers will not know the name of the other party to the Transaction until the Transaction is completed. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will share the applicable Buyer’s city, state, and zip with the Seller so that the Seller can calculate the appropriate tax (if any) to remit to the appropriate government entity. We will share the Seller’s legal name on the Buyer’s invoice. Buyers and Sellers may not use information about the Transaction or about the other party gained in connection with a Transaction (“Transaction Information”) for any purpose that is not related to the Transaction. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (1) disclose any Transaction Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your tax obligations or other obligations under these Service Terms and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with these restrictions; (2) use any Transaction Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (3) use any Transaction Information in any way inconsistent with applicable law; (4) contact a party to influence them to make an alternative sale or purchase; or (5) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an RI Marketplace Buyer or Seller.\\n5.7.

If you inform your AWS training representative in writing within 2 business days of the start date that you do not have access to your Seats, your Team Subscription will not start until AWS confirms you have access. Seats may only be used by a single person for the entire term of the Team Subscription, except that you may reassign up to twenty percent of Seats within your organization during the term of the Team Subscription.\\n67.4.3.1. Additional Seats. You may purchase additional Seats under your existing Team Subscription by contacting your AWS Training representative as described on the AWS Training detail page on the AWS Site. Your start date for additional Seats begins when AWS gives your learning administrator(s) access, and any additional Seats purchased will expire at the end of your existing Team Subscription. Fees for additional Seats are calculated pro-rata based on the time remaining in your existing Team Subscription.\\n67.4.4. Auto-Renewal. Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, your Digital Training subscription will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable subscription service fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you. We may change the Digital Training subscription service fee from time to time by notifying you of the change and effective date before it takes effect. You may reject the change by cancelling your subscription at no additional cost at any time before a subscription service fee change takes effect. From time to time we may also offer non-recurring subscriptions. The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those subscriptions.\\nIf all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription service fees, your subscription will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method that is successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.\\n67.5. Enterprise Skills Transformation\\n67.5.1. Access. To enable EST support and guidance, AWS may require access to your internal communication systems including but not limited to email, instant messaging, and other systems related to such access as identified by you (“Customer Systems”). When accessing Customer Systems, AWS agrees to comply with your reasonable policies and procedures, to the extent such policies and procedures are (i) applicable to such access and use, and (ii) do not conflict with the Agreement. Subject to your prior approval, you will arrange for AWS to have reasonable access to your Customer Systems to the extent required to enable EST, and at no additional cost to AWS. You may revoke your access approval at any time. AWS is not responsible for any failure to perform caused by your revocation of AWS’ access to your Customer Systems.\\n67.5.2. Cancellation. Either you or AWS may cancel your EST engagement with 15 days written notice, which may be via email. AWS will charge you for the full month during which the cancellation takes effect.\\n68.

We may use these metrics and data to provide, maintain, and improve the quality and feature sets of the Services and AWS Content.\\n70. AWS IQ\\n70.1. AWS IQ Experts (“Providers”) offer their services (“Provider Services”) as independent contractors, and are not employees of you or us. AWS is not a party to the agreement between you and any Providers for their Provider Services, is not responsible or liable for Provider Services, and does not guarantee the quality or accuracy of Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, any certification that a Provider obtains from us only certifies that the Provider has passed a test intended to evaluate the Provider’s proficiency and understanding of a particular AWS Service or area of knowledge to which that certification relates, and is not a guarantee that the Provider Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements.  \\n70.2. AWS charges service fees for transactions between you and Providers on the AWS IQ marketplace. AWS only collects these service fees if you and a Provider pay and receive payment through the AWS IQ marketplace. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify a Provider through AWS IQ, you agree to use AWS IQ as your exclusive method to pay for Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, if you did not identify a Provider through use of AWS IQ, such as if you worked with a Provider prior to connecting with that Provider on AWS IQ, then this section does not apply.  \\n70.3. You acknowledge and agree that we may use information from AWS IQ listings, proposals, chat communications, and additional terms proposed or agreed to between you and Providers on AWS IQ to develop and improve the quality and feature set of AWS IQ.   \\n70.4.

You will immediately revoke Provider’s access to your AWS account if you become aware of any violation of your obligations under the Agreement or the Intellectual Property License caused by a Provider with access to your AWS account. If you use AWS IQ’s feature that allows you to grant a Provider access to your account, AWS may, but is not obligated to, review activities in your account for security purposes, and may revoke the Provider’s access at any time.\\n70.5. You release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of any and every kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the AWS IQ marketplace.  \\n71.

The On-Demand Instances must match certain specifications of the\\n\\t\\t\\tReserved Instances in order to benefit from the billing discount.\\n\\nIf you purchase a Reserved Instance and you already have a running On-Demand Instance that matches the\\n\\t\\t\\tspecifications of the Reserved Instance, the billing discount is applied immediately and\\n\\t\\t\\tautomatically. You do not have to restart your instances. If you do not have an eligible\\n\\t\\t\\trunning On-Demand Instance, launch an On-Demand Instance with the same specifications as your Reserved Instance. For more\\n\\t\\t\\tinformation, see Use your Reserved Instances.\\n\\nThe offering class (Standard or Convertible) of the Reserved Instance does not affect how the\\n\\t\\t\\tbilling discount is applied.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nHow zonal Reserved Instances are applied\\n\\nHow regional Reserved Instances are applied\\n\\nInstance size flexibility\\n\\nExamples of applying Reserved Instances\\n\\nHow zonal Reserved Instances are applied\\n\\nA Reserved Instance that is purchased to reserve capacity in a specific Availability Zone is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled a zonal Reserved Instance.\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance discount applies to matching instance usage in that Availability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZone.\\n\\nThe attributes (tenancy, platform, Availability Zone, instance type, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance size) of the running instances must match that of the Reserved Instances.\\n\\nFor example, if you purchase two c4.xlarge default tenancy Linux/Unix\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStandard Reserved Instances for Availability Zone us-east-1a, then up to two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tc4.xlarge default tenancy Linux/Unix instances running in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a can benefit from the Reserved Instance discount.\\n\\nHow regional Reserved Instances are applied\\n\\nA Reserved Instance that is purchased for a Region is called a regional Reserved Instance, and provides\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone and instance size flexibility.\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage in any Availability Zone in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Region.\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage within the instance family,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tregardless of sizeâthis is known as instance size\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflexibility.\\n\\nInstance size flexibility\\n\\nWith instance size flexibility, the Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstances that have the same  family. The Reserved Instance is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplied from the smallest to the largest instance size within the instance family\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the normalization factor.

The discount applies either fully or partially to running\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstances of the same instance family, depending on the instance size of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treservation, in any Availability Zone in the Region. The only attributes that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmust be matched are the instance family, tenancy, and platform.\\n\\nThe following table lists the different sizes within an instance family, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe corresponding normalization factor.

Virginia), and you have one running i3.metal instance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin that Region, the billing benefit is applied in full to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ti3.metal instance.\\n\\nExamples of applying Reserved Instances\\n\\nThe following scenarios cover the ways in which Reserved Instances are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplied.\\n\\nScenario 1: Reserved Instances in a single account\\n\\nScenario 2: Reserved Instances in a single account using the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnormalization factor\\n\\nScenario 3: Regional Reserved Instances in linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccounts\\n\\nScenario 4: Zonal Reserved Instances in a linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount\\n\\nScenario 1: Reserved Instances in a single account\\n\\nYou are running the following On-Demand Instances in account A:\\n\\n4 x m3.large Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\n2 x m4.xlarge Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1b\\n\\n1 x c4.xlarge Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1c\\n\\nYou purchase the following Reserved Instances in account A:\\n\\n4 x m3.large Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Availability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZone us-east-1a (capacity is reserved)\\n\\n4 x m4.large Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRegion us-east-1\\n\\n1 x c4.large Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRegion us-east-1\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:\\n\\nThe discount and capacity reservation of the four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.large zonal Reserved Instances is used by the four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.large instances because the attributes (instance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsize, Region, platform, tenancy) between them match.\\n\\nThe m4.large regional Reserved Instances provide Availability Zone and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance size flexibility, because they are regional Amazon Linux Reserved Instances\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith default tenancy.\\n\\nAn m4.large is equivalent to 4 normalized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunits/hour.\\n\\nYou've purchased four m4.large regional Reserved Instances, and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttotal, they are equal to 16 normalized units/hour (4x4). Account A has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo m4.xlarge instances running, which is equivalent to 16\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnormalized units/hour (2x8). In this case, the four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm4.large regional Reserved Instances provide the full billing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit to the usage of the two m4.xlarge instances.\\n\\nThe c4.large regional Reserved Instance in us-east-1 provides\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone and instance size flexibility, because it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tregional Amazon Linux Reserved Instance with default tenancy, and applies to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tc4.xlarge instance. A c4.large instance is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent to 4 normalized units/hour and a c4.xlarge is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent to 8 normalized units/hour.\\n\\nIn this case, the c4.large regional Reserved Instance provides partial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit to c4.xlarge usage. This is because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tc4.large Reserved Instance is equivalent to 4 normalized units/hour\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof usage, but the c4.xlarge instance requires 8 normalized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunits/hour. Therefore, the c4.large Reserved Instance billing discount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tapplies to 50% of c4.xlarge usage. The remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tc4.xlarge usage is charged at the On-Demand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trate.\\n\\nScenario 2: Reserved Instances in a single account using the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnormalization factor\\n\\nYou are running the following On-Demand Instances in account A:\\n\\n2 x m3.xlarge Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\n2 x m3.large Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1b\\n\\nYou purchase the following Reserved Instance in account A:\\n\\n1 x m3.2xlarge Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instance in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRegion us-east-1\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:\\n\\nThe m3.2xlarge regional Reserved Instance in us-east-1 provides\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone and instance size flexibility, because it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tregional Amazon Linux Reserved Instance with default tenancy. It applies first to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.large instances and then to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.xlarge instances, because it applies from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsmallest to the largest instance size within the instance family based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton the normalization factor.\\n\\nAn m3.large instance is equivalent to 4 normalized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunits/hour.\\n\\nAn m3.xlarge instance is equivalent to 8 normalized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunits/hour.\\n\\nAn m3.2xlarge instance is equivalent to 16 normalized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunits/hour.\\n\\nThe benefit is applied as follows:\\n\\nThe m3.2xlarge regional Reserved Instance provides full benefit to 2 x\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.large usage, because together these instances\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount for 8 normalized units/hour. This leaves 8 normalized units/hour\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto apply to the m3.xlarge instances.\\n\\nWith the remaining 8 normalized units/hour, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.2xlarge regional Reserved Instance provides full benefit to 1 x\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.xlarge usage, because each m3.xlarge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance is equivalent to 8 normalized units/hour. The remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm3.xlarge usage is charged at the On-Demand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trate.\\n\\nScenario 3: Regional Reserved Instances in linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccounts\\n\\nReserved Instances are first applied to usage within the purchasing account, followed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tqualifying usage in any other account in the organization. For more information,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsee Reserved Instances and consolidated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbilling. For regional Reserved Instances\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat offer instance size flexibility, the benefit is applied from the smallest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto the largest instance size within the instance family.\\n\\nYou're running the following On-Demand Instances in account A (the purchasing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount):\\n\\n2 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\n1 x m4.2xlarge Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1b\\n\\n2 x c4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\n1 x c4.2xlarge Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1b\\n\\nAnother customer is running the following On-Demand Instances in account Bâa linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount:\\n\\n2 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\nYou purchase the following regional Reserved Instances in account A:\\n\\n4 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Region\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tus-east-1\\n\\n2 x c4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Region\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tus-east-1\\n\\nThe regional Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:\\n\\nThe discount of the four m4.xlarge Reserved Instances is used by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo m4.xlarge instances and the single\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tm4.2xlarge instance in account A (purchasing account).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll three instances match the attributes (instance family, Region,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tplatform, tenancy). The discount is applied to instances in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpurchasing account (account A) first, even though account B (linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount) has two m4.xlarge that also match the Reserved Instances. There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis no capacity reservation because the Reserved Instances are regional Reserved Instances.\\n\\nThe discount of the two c4.xlarge Reserved Instances applies to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo c4.xlarge instances, because they are a smaller\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance size than the c4.2xlarge instance. There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcapacity reservation because the Reserved Instances are regional Reserved Instances.\\n\\nScenario 4: Zonal Reserved Instances in a linked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount\\n\\nIn general, Reserved Instances that are owned by an account are applied first to usage in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat account. However, if there are qualifying, unused Reserved Instances for a specific\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone (zonal Reserved Instances) in other accounts in the organization, they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tapplied to the account before regional Reserved Instances owned by the account. This is done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto ensure maximum Reserved Instance utilization and a lower bill. For billing purposes, all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe accounts in the organization are treated as one account. The following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texample might help explain this.\\n\\nYou're running the following On-Demand Instance in account A (the purchasing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount):\\n\\n1 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy instance in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\nA customer is running the following On-Demand Instance in linked account B:\\n\\n1 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy instance in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1b\\n\\nYou purchase the following regional Reserved Instances in account A:\\n\\n1 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instance in Region\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tus-east-1\\n\\nA customer also purchases the following zonal Reserved Instances in linked account\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC:\\n\\n1 x m4.xlarge Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvailability Zone us-east-1a\\n\\nThe Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:\\n\\nThe discount of the m4.xlarge zonal Reserved Instance owned by account\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC is applied to the m4.xlarge usage in account A.\\n\\nThe discount of the m4.xlarge regional Reserved Instance owned by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccount A is applied to the m4.xlarge usage in account\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tB.\\n\\nIf the regional Reserved Instance owned by account A was first applied to the usage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin account A, the zonal Reserved Instance owned by account C remains unused and usage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin account B is charged at On-Demand rates.\\n\\nFor more information, see Understanding your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treservations in the AWS Cost and Usage Report.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nZonal Reserved Instances reserve capacity only for the owning account and cannot be shared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith other AWS accounts.

      "[5]: [Amazon Bedrock offers two pricing plans for inference: 1. On-Demand and Batch mode with pay-as-you-go pricing and no commitments, and 2. Provisioned Throughput mode for consistent workloads with 1-month or 6-month commitments. Batch mode offers up to 50% lower costs compared to on-demand pricing for select foundation models.]\n",
      "\n",
      "[6]: [Provisioned Throughput mode allows you to reserve model units for specific base or custom models, designed for large consistent inference workloads needing guaranteed throughput. Custom models can only be accessed using Provisioned Throughput. Pricing is charged hourly with 1-month or 6-month commitment terms available.]\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "The research has identified comprehensive pricing information for both Nova and Claude series models, including on-demand, batch, and provisioned throughput options. Cost optimization features like prompt caching and intelligent routing are available to help reduce costs. The RI policy is implemented through Provisioned Throughput with 1-month or 6-month commitments, offering guaranteed performance for consistent workloads.\n",
