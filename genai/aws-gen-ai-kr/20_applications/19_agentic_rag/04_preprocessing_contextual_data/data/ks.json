That way, the original seats won't expire before the new seats on the same license key. \n\nThe modified expiration date is calculated as the average of all the expiration dates of the seats on the license, which can either reduce or extend your existing license expiration date. \n\nFor example, if your existing license key currently has 2 seats and expires on November 22, 2024, and you'd like to append an additional five seats with an expiry date on January 3, 2025, your new license key will have seven seats and a modified expiry date of December 22, 2024. \n",
