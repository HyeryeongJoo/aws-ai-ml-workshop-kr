    "\n",
    "Welcome to this training module on post-call analytics use cases using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. \n",
    "\n",
    "As businesses continue to interact with customers through various channels, it becomes increasingly important to analyze these interactions to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. Post-call analytics is one such method that involves analyzing customer interactions after the call has ended. The use of large language models can greatly enhance the effectiveness of post-call analytics by enabling more accurate sentiment analysis, identifying specific customer needs and preferences, and improving overall customer experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample notebook, we will explore following topics to demonstrate the various benefits of using Bedrock for post-call analytics and businesses gain a competitive edge in the modern marketplace.\n",

      "AWS is a cloud service provider that offers various computing services that are accessible over the public internet. AWS and other public cloud vendors manage and maintain hardware and infrastructure, saving organizations and individuals the cost and complexity of purchasing and running resources on site. These resources may be accessed for free or on a pay-per-use basis. AWS is a massive service provider, with one in three sites on the internet using AWS services. In 2019, Amazon Web Services raked in more than $35 billion in revenue.\n",

      "The history of AWS\n",
      "The origins of AWS are kind of unintentional. Way back around the year 2000, Amazon was still just a scrappy e-commerce company that found itself struggling to grow under all the technical debt that it accumulated since its startup days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much out of necessity, Amazon made the strategic technology decision to start building reusable modules for its internal development groups. This allowed those groups to create new features faster because they weren't always reinventing the same things over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on, the collection of internal services grew, and people inside the company started to realize that maybe there was a potential business opportunity there.\n",
      "\n",
      "First launched in 2004 and then relaunched in 2006 with three public pay-as-you-go services, Amazon Web Services set sail into the uncharted waters of what we now call cloud computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After it launched in 2006, for the next few years, AWS enjoyed a relatively quiet competitive landscape, allowing it to build a dramatic headstart over contemporary competitors like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS has been the dominant cloud provider for a while and is the clear market-share leader at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the past few years, that market share has been eroding slightly, largely going to Microsoft Azure. But competition is a good thing, and AWS has momentum, market-share profitability, and some really smart people on its side. The innovation and customer focus are greater than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "What's the future hold for AWS? They say no one can predict the future . . . but we asked a panel of experts to do it anyways. Check out our 7 predictions for AWS.\n",

      "The retail support call transcript is a conversation between a customer and an AWS support representative. The customer is having trouble with their AWS account and is seeking assistance. The representative asks the customer for their account information and confirms that the customer has a valid AWS account. The representative then asks the customer to provide more information about the issue they are experiencing. The customer explains that they are unable to access their account and are receiving an error message. The representative asks the customer to provide more details about the error message and tries to troubleshoot the issue. The representative suggests that the customer try resetting their password and checking their account settings. The customer agrees to try these steps and the representative offers to stay on the line to assist if necessary. The conversation ends with the representative thanking the customer for their time and wishing them a good day.\n",
