### What to use for your AI/ML workshop

We recommend to use the latest material stored in `/YEAR-MM` directory. Each `/YEAR-MM` directory has README.MD file that explains the change from the previous version. Read it carefully if it meets with your needs.

## How to contribute your work

* If you find typos or errors in Jupyter Notebook codes in existing notebooks under `/YEAR-MM`, please directly push your changes.
* This is same to all documents under `/LabGuide`.
* When creating your notebook and if it is using any images, please put that images under `/images` directory. You may simply include the image in your Markdown cell in this way: `<img src="../images/Factorization2.png" alt="Factorization" style="width: 800px;"/>`
* Or else if you want to revise the content or propose a new lab, please push it to `/Contribution`. We will review the content and decide whether to replace an existing module or to add it as a new module. The maintainer will accordingly modify or prepare a lab guide if your notebook contains good enough information for us to prepare a lab guide. Otherwise we will reach you back for further questions.
